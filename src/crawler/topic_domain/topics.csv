We have also revised the § 106.30 definition of “actual knowledge” to specify that “notice” conveying actual knowledge on the recipient includes reporting sexual harassment to the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator as described in  § \n106.8(a). Comments : Some commenters expressed confusion as to whether the “grievance procedures” \nreferenced in § 106.8(c) would apply to sexual harassment, sex discrimination generally, or both. \nSome commenters criticized the § 106.45 grievance process as “extreme” and argued that \nrecipients should not have to use the same “weaponized” process to address non -sexual \nharassment sex discrimination. Other commenters asserted that the proposed rules created a dual \nsystem of grievance procedures: “prompt and equitable” grievance procedures applicable to sex discrimination generally, and to “informal complaints” of sexual harassment, and separate grievance procedures (described in § 106.45) for formal complaints of sexual harassment. Some commenters asserted that the phrasing in propo sed § 106.8(c) was unnecessarily confusing \n1713 Section 106.44(a) (describing a recipient’s general response obligations upon having actual knowledge of sexual \nharassment against a person in the United States in the recipient’s education p rogram or activity). \n1631  \n   \n \n    \n    \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n    \n    \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

A recipient ’s Title IX Coordinator also must promptly contact the \ncomplain ant to discuss the availability of supportive measures as defined in § 106.30, consider \nthe complainant’s wishes with respect to supportive measures, inform the complainant of the availability of supportive measures with or without the filing of a formal c omplaint, and explain \nto the complainant the process for filing a formal complaint. These revisions clarify a recipient’s obligation with respect to supportive measures. \nWith respect to the concern about retaliation, the Department added a provision in § \n106.71 to prohibit retaliation, and this provision is explained in more detail in the section on “Retaliation” subsection of the “Miscellaneous” section in this preamble. \nThe Department acknowledges that both the Clery Act and its implementing regulations \ninclude the term “victim,” while these final regulations include and define the term \n“complainant.” The Department again notes that the purpose of the Clery Act differs f rom the \npurpose of Title IX. The Clery Act generally concerns the disclosure of campus security policy and campus crime statistics, and the term “victim” is appropriate in the context of crime or criminal activity . Title IX concerns discrimination on the basis of sex, and these final regulations \nspecifically address sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment . \nThe Department defines a complainant as “an individual who is alleged to be the victim \nof conduct that could constitute sexual harassment” u nder § 106.30 and uses the word “victim” \nin that context. Under these final regulations, a recipient has an obligation to respond to a report of sexual harassment that occurs in its education program or activity against a person in the United States, irrespective of whether the complainant chooses to file a formal complaint. \n1844  \n  \n    \n    \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n   \n    \n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n  \n   \n   \n    \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Accordingly, the term “complainant” is more appropriate for the structure \nand purpose of these final regulations to address sexual harassment under Title IX. The \nDepartment explains its decision to remove the phrase “or on whose behalf the Title IX \nCoordinator has filed a formal complaint” from the definition of complainant in § 106.30 as \nexplained in the “Complainant” subsection of the “ Section  106.30 Definitions” section of this \npreamble.

A recipient’s treatment of a complainant or a \nrespondent in response to a formal complaint of sexual harassment may constitute discrimination \non the basis of sex under title IX. \n(b) Grievance process. For the purpose of addressing formal complaints of sexual \nharassment, a recipient’s grievance process must comply with the requirements of this section. Any provisions, rules, or practices other than those required by this section that a recipient \nadopts as part of its grievance process for handling formal complaints of sexual harassment as \ndefined in § 106.30, must apply equally to both parties. \n(1) Basic requirements for grievance process. A recipient’s grievance process must — \n(i)Treat complainants and respondents equitably by providing remedies to a complainant \nwhere a determination of responsibility for sexual harassment has been made against the \nrespondent, and by following a grievance process that complies with this section  before the \nimposition of any disciplinary sanctions or other actions that are not supportive measures as \ndefined in § 106.30, against a respondent. Remedies must be designed to restore or preserve \nequal access to the recipient’s education program or activity. Such remedies may include the same individualized services described in § 106.30 as “supportive measures”; however, remedies need not be non-disciplinary or non-punitive and need not avoid burdening the respondent; \n(ii) Require an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence – including both inculpatory \nand exculpatory evidence – and provide that credibility determinations may not be based on a person’s status as a complainant, respondent, or witness; \n2018  \n    \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n     \n \n  \n    \n  \n  \n   \n      \n    \n   \n  \n   \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

A recipient must ensure that \nTitle IX Coordinators, investigators, decision -makers, and any person who facilitates an informal \nresolution process, receive training on the definition of sexual harassment in § 106.30, the scope \nof the recipient’s education program or activity, how to conduct an investigation and grievance process including hearings, appeals, and informal resolution processes, as applicable, and how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudg ment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, \nand bias.', 'We have revised the definitions of “complainant” and “formal complaint” in § 106.30 to clarify that when a Title IX Coordinator chooses to sign a formal complaint, that action is not taken “on behalf of” the complainant; the “complainant” is the person who is alleged to be the \n941 The section number, 106.44(b)(2), now refers to the provision discussed in the “ Section 106.44(b)(2) OCR Will \nNot Re -weigh the Evidence” subsection of the “Recipient’s Response in Specific Circumstances” subsection of the \n“Section 106.44 Recipient’s Response to Sexual Harassment, Generally” section of this preamble. \n696  \n    \n  \n \n    \n    \n \n   \n   \n   \n     \n  \n  \n   \n     \n  \n   \n    \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Those revisions further clarify that \nwhen a Title IX Coordinator signs a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator does not become a complainant or otherwise a party to the grievance process, and must abide by § 106.45(b)(1)(iii), which requires Title IX personnel to be free from conflicts of interest and bias, and serve impartially. We do not believe that signing a formal complaint that initiates a grievance process inherently creates a conflict of interest between th e Title IX Coordinator and \nthe respondent; in such a situation, the Title IX Coordinator is not advocating for or against the complainant or respondent, and is not subscribing to the truth of the allegations, but is rather instituting a grievance process (on behalf of the recipient, not on behalf of the complainant) based on reported sexual harassment so that the recipient may factually determine, through a fair and impartial grievance process, whether or not sexual harassment occurred in the recipient’s education program or activity. \nThe Department is persuaded by commenters ’ concerns that the proposed provision \nwould have created tension with § 106.45(b)(6)(i), which mandates that if a party or witness does \nnot submit to cross-examination at the hearing, the decision-maker must not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility. The Department is persuaded by commenters’ argument s that the proposed provision would have \nincentivized or forced recipients to file futile complaints against respondents with no complaining witness willing to testify at a live hearing. Whether or not proposed § 106.44(b)(2) \nwould have conflicted with § 106.45(b)(3), the proposed provision § 106.44(b)(2) has been removed from the final regulations, and we have revised § 106.45(b)(3) to clarify that a recipient \nmay choose to address allegations of sexual harassment that occurred outside the recipient’s education program or activity, through non-Title IX codes of conduct.

While the \nDepartment believes that the § 106.45 grievance process provides an appropriately fair \nframework for many types of school disciplinary matters, the Department is authorized to prescribe § 106.45 for resolution of formal complaints of Title IX sexual harassment because \nconsistent processes reaching reliable factual determinations are needed in order to provide remedies to sexual harassment victims ( to further Title IX’s purpose) and because Title IX sexual \nharassment allegations inherently invite intentional or unintentional application of sex -based \nassumptions, generalizations, and stereotypes (which violate Title IX’s non-discrimination \nmandate). \nThe Department declines to apply the § 106.45 grievance process only to formal \ncomplaints alleging sexual assault, involving allegations of violence, or otherwise subjecting a respondent to expulsion. As discussed under § 106.44(a) and § 106.30, the Department has defined sexual harassment to include three categories of misconduct on the basis of sex  (quid pro \nquo harassment by an employee; severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive unwelcome conduct; and sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined under the \nClery Act and VAWA). Each of these categories of misconduct is a serious violation that \njeopardizes a victim’s equal access to education. Formal complaints alleging any ty pe of sexual \nharassment , as defined in § 106.30, must be handled under a process designed to reliably \ndetermine the facts surrounding each allegation so that recipients provide remedies to victims \nsubjected to that serious misconduct. The final regulation s do not prescribe any particular form \nof disciplinary sanction for sexual harassment. Therefore, the Department declines to apply § 106.45 only when a respondent faces expulsion; rather, § 106.45 applies to formal complaints \n279  \n     \n  \n \n  \n \n    \n   \n  \n  \n     \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n    \n \n \n       \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Thus, § 106.8(c) better ensures that students, employees, parents of elementary and secondary \nschool students, applicants for admission and employment, and unions, all are aware of a \nrecipient’s proced ures and processes for intaking reports and complaints of all forms of sex \ndiscrimination including the particular reporting system, grievance process, and recipient responses required under these final regulations regarding sexual harassment.  For reasons \ndiscussed throughout this preamble, including in the “General Support and Opposition for the Grievance Process in § 106.45” section of this preamble, the Department believes that the prescribed procedures that recipients must use in a Title IX sexual harassment grievance process are necessary to achieve the purposes of increasing the legitimacy and reliability of recipient determinations regarding responsibility for sexual harassment while decreasing the likelihood of sex-based  bias influencing such determi nations , and we clarify in revised § 106.8(c) that the § \n1636  \n     \n    \n    \n  \n    \n   \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n  \n \n \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Discussion : Title IX expressly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and not race, \ndisability, or other protected characteristics, and the Department does not have the legal authority to promulgate regulations addressing discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics, other than sex, under Titl e IX. The Department enforces other statutes such as Title VI, which \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. T he Department’s other \nregulations specifically address discrimination based on these and other protected characteristics. \nThese final regulations require that all policies, information, education, training, reporting \noptions, and adjudication processes be accessible and fair for all students . For example, any \ncomplainant will be offered supportive measures, even if that person does not wish to file a \nformal complaint under § 106.44(a). Any respondent will receive the due process protections in the § 106.45 grievance process before the imposition of any disciplinary sanctions for sexual \nharassment under § 106.44(a). Additionally, the recipient’s non- discrimination statement, \ndesignation of a Title IX Coordinator, policy, grievance procedures, and training materials should be readily accessible to all students pursuant to § 106.8 and § 106.45(b) (10)(i)(D). \nFor the reasons previously explained, the Department does not define sex in these final \nregulations, as these final regulations focus on prohibited conduct, namely sexual harassment as \n560  \n  \n   \n    \n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n   \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

As previously explained, the Department’s definition of sexual \nharassment applies for the protection of any person who experiences sexual harassment, \nregardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. \nAlthough these final regulations constitute the Department’s first promulgation of \nregulatio ns that address sexual harassment, these final regulations also make revisions to pre-\nexisting regulations and regulations such as regulations in subpart A and subpart B of Part 106 that generally address sex discrimination but do not specifically address sexual harassment . For \nexample, the Department revises § 106.8, which concerns the designation of a Title IX Coordinator who will address all forms of discrimination on the basis of sex and not just sexual harassment . The Department clarifies in § 106.8(c) that a recipient must adopt and publish \ngrievance procedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints, alleging any action that would be prohibited by Part 106 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and also a grievance process that complies with § 106.45 for \nformal complaints of sexual harassment as defined in § 106.30. Section 106.8(c) thus clarifies \nthat a recipient does not need to apply or use the grievance process in § 106.45 for complaints alleging sex discrimination that does not constitute sexual harassment. \nChanges : None. \nSupportive Measures \nOverall Support and Opposition \nComments : Many comment ers supported the definition of “supportive measures” in § 106.30 \nbecause the provision states that supportive measures may be offered to complainants and respondents; commenters asserted  that supportive measures should be offered on an equal basis \nto all parties, except to the extent public safety concerns would require different treatment, \n561  \n   \n  \n \n   \n     \n  \n \n   \n \n    \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

These final regulations also do not appear to conflict with court practices in Illinois regarding sharing documents with complainants \nand respondents. The commenter appears to reference a practice by Illinois courts and does not indicate that the State mandates that postsecondary institutions or elementary and secondary \nschools comply with a court pr actice  to provide documents to an attorney rather than to a \ndefendant.

Supportive measures must not \nhave a punitive or disciplinary consequence for either complainants or respondents. \nEven without the proposed safe harbor provision regarding supportive measures, the \nDepartment believes that these final regulations appropriately draw recipients’ attention to the \nimportance of offering supportive measures to all students, including students who do not wish to initiate a recipient’s formal grievance process, and thus give complainants greater autonomy to \ndecide if supportive measures, alone, represent the kind of school- level response that will best \nhelp the complainant heal after any trauma. The Department in part requires a recipient to offer \nsupportive measures to all complainants under § 106.44(a) because the Department recognizes that, in many cases, a complainant’s equal access to education can be effectively restored or preserved thro ugh the school’s provision of supportive measures. Accordingly, the Department \nprovides an additional mandate in § 106.44(b)(1) , that with or without a formal complaint, a \nrecipient must comply with § 106.44(a) (e.g., by offering the complainant supportive measures) . \nWe are persuaded by commenters’ assertions that providing supportive measures to a \ncomplainant does not always satisfy a recipient’s obligation to respond in a non- deliberately \nindifferent manner to known sexual harassment. In some circumstances and depending on the unique facts, a non- deliberately indifferent response may require the recipient’s Title IX \nCoordinator to sign a formal complaint as defined in § 106.30 so that the recipient initiates the grievance process in § 106.45. The Department acknowledges that a recipient should respect the complainant’s autonomy and wishes with respect to a formal complaint and grievance process to the extent possible. \nAs the proposed safe harbor regarding supportive measures is no longer included in these \nfinal regulations, we do not revisit whether excluding elementary and secondary school \n707  \n     \n  \n   \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n  \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n     \n    \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Revised § 106.44(a) requires ever y recipient \n(including elementary and secondary schools) to offer supportive measures to complainants. \nThe Department understands the concern that a recipient may coerce potential \ncomplainants into accepting supportive measures in lieu of a formal grievance process. Partly in \nresponse to these concerns, the Department revised § 106.44(a) to require that a Title IX Coordinator promptly contact a complainant not only to discuss supportive measures but also to explain to the complainant the process for filing a formal complaint. Accordingly, a complainant will know how to file a formal complaint, if the complainant wishes to do so.', 'A recipient also may provide both parties with an opportunity to respond to any additional evidence the other party proposes \n1042  \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n      \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n       \n  \n   \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The Department agrees with commenters who note d that this conclusion \nhas been reached by courts both in the context of constitutional due process in public institutions and a fair process in private institutions. The Department agr ees with commenters who observed \nthat some States already provide rights to a robust hearing and cross- examination under State \nAPA laws, demonstrating that the notion of live hearings and cross-examination is not new or foreign to many postsecondary institutions. The Department is aware that many postsecondary institutions have created disciplinary systems for sexual misconduct issues that intentionally avoid live hearings and cross -examination, due to concern about retraumatizing sexual assault \nvictims; ho wever, the Department agrees with commenters that in too many instances recipients \nwho have refused to permit parties or their advisors to conduct cross -examination and instead \nallowed questions to be posed through hearing panels have stifled the value of cross -examination \nby, for example, refusing to ask relevant questions posed by a party, changing the wording of a party’s question, or refusing to allow follow -up questions. \nThe Department agrees with commenters that cross- examination serves the interests of \ncomplainants, respondents, and recipients , by giving the decision-maker the opportunity to \nobserve parties and witnesses answer questions, including those challenging credibility, thus serving the truth-seeking purpose of an adjudication. The Department acknowledges that Title IX grievance processes are not criminal proceedings and thus constitutional protections available to criminal defendants (such as the right to confront one’s accuser under the Sixth Amendment) do not apply in the educational conte xt; however, the Department agrees with commenters that \ncross-examination is a valuable tool for resolving the truth of serious allegations such as those \n1052  \n    \n   \n   \n \n      \n   \n   \n   \n \n  \n  \n   \n     \n   \n   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n            \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The Department emphasizes that cross-\nexamination that may reveal faulty memory, mistaken beliefs, or inaccurate facts about allegations does not  mean that the party answering questions is necessarily lying or making \nintentionally false statements . The Department’s belief that cross- examination serves a valuable \npurpose in resolving factual allegations does not reflect a belief that false accusations occur with any particular frequency in the context of sexual misconduct proceedings. However, the degree to which any inaccuracy, inconsistency, or implausibility in a narrative provided by a party or \nwitness should affect a determination regarding responsibility is a matter to be decided by the decision-maker, after having the opportunity to ask questions of parties and witnesses, and to observe how parties and witnesses answer the questions posed by the other party.', 'The Department understands commenters’ concerns about the prospect of cross-\nexamination, and appreciates commenters’ personal experiences with the difficulties of cross -\nexamination, but reiterates that cross -examination essentially consists of questions posed from \none party’s perspective to advance the asking party’s vie ws about the allegations at issue, that \nrecipients retain discretion to control the conduct of cross-examination in a manner that ensures that no party is treated abusively or disrespectfully, that only relevant cross -examination \n1065  \n  \n   \n  \n \n    \n  \n   \n    \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n    \n     \n  \n \n \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Based on comments from many recipients, the Department \nbelieves that recipients desire to treat all their students and employees with dignity and respect, and that recipients will therefore conduct hearings in a manner that keeps the focus on respectful \nquestioning regarding the allegations at issue while permitting each party (through advisors) to advocate for the party’s own interests before the decision- maker. \nThe Department appreciates commenters’ support for ensuring that both parties have \nequal rights with respect to cross -examination, but disagrees that § 106.45(b)(6)(i) is intrusive or \nmyopic because, for reasons explained throughout this preamble, the Department has determined \nthat in the context of resolution of Title IX sexual harassment allegations the procedures in § 106.45 constitute those procedures necessary to ensure consistent, predictable application of Title IX rights, and does not believe that cross-examination in the postsecondary context tilts the system against sexual harassment victims. An equal right of cross- examination benefits \ncomplainants as well as respondents, by permitting complainants to participate in advocating for their own view of the case so that a decision -maker is more likely to reach an accurate \ndetermination, and where a respondent is found responsible the victim will receive remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to education. Changes : We have revised § 1 06.45(b)(6)(i) to state that cross -examination must occur “directly, \norally, and in real-time” by a party’s advisor “and never by a party personally” and that upon a party’s request the entire live hearing (not only cross -examination) must occur with the p arties \nlocated in separate rooms (with technology enabling participants to see and hear each other). We have further revised § 106.45(b)(6)(i) to state that only relevant cross -examination questions \nmust be answered, and the decision- maker must determine the relevance of a cross- examination \n1066  \n   \n \n     \n  \n   \n    \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n    \n \n   \n \n \n \n           \n                \n                \n               \n              \n \n               \n                  \n            \n                    \n \n \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The Department agrees with commenters that even so -\ncalled “he said/she said” cases often involve evidence in addition to the parties’ respective narratives, and the § 106.45 grievance process obligates recipients to bear the burden of gathering evidence and to objectively evaluate all relevant evidence, both inculpat ory and \nexculpatory, including the parties’ own statements as well as other evidence. The Department disagrees that cross-examination disincentivizes recipients from conducting a full investigation that uncovers all relevant evidence, in part because § 106.45 obligates recipients to gather relevant evidence, and in part because cross -examination occurs at the end of the grievance \nprocess such that the parties have already had an opportunity to inspect and review the evidence collected by the recipient. \nThe Department acknowledges commenters’ concerns that under § 106.45(b)(6)(i) cross-\nexamination is conducted by party advisors, and the final regulations do not require a party’s advisor of choice to be an attorney, nor may a recipient restrict a party’s c hoice of advisor, \nresulting in scenarios where a party’s advisor may be the party’s friend or relative or other person who may not be trained or experienced in conducting cross-examination. Regardless of \n1218 We have also revised § 106.45(b)(1)(iii) to specifically require that decision -makers are trained on issues of \nrelevance, including application of the “rape shield” protections in § 106.45(b)(6). \n1073  \n  \n     \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n   \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n   \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

A multiplicity of definitions would not serve this purpose.’’\n90 \nIn addition to using the Davis \ndefinition verbatim (i.e., conduct that is \nso severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education), the proposed regulations defined ‘‘sexual harassment’’ to also include sexual assault as defined in the Clery Act. In these final regulations, the Department retains reference to sexual assault under the Clery Act, and additionally incorporates the definitions of dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in the Clery Act as amended by VAWA.\n91Incorporating these four Clery \nAct/VAWA offenses clarifies that sexual harassment includes a single instance of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking. Such incorporation is consistent with the Supreme Court’s observation in Davis that a single instance of sufficiently severe harassment on the basis of sex may have the systemic effect of denying \nthe victim equal access to an education program or activity.\n92However, the \nDepartment’s inclusion of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in the § 106.30 definition of sexual harassment, without requiring those sex offenses to meet the Davis elements of severity, \npervasiveness, and objective offensiveness, appropriately guards against, for instance, some sexual assaults or incidents of dating violence or domestic violence being covered under Title IX while other sexual assaults or incidents of dating violence or domestic violence are deemed not to be ‘‘pervasive’’ enough to meet the Davis standard. Similarly, this approach \nguards against a pattern of sex-based stalking being deemed ‘‘not severe’’ even though the pattern of behavior is ‘‘pervasive.’’ Such incorporation also provides consistency and clarity with respect to the intersection among Title IX, the Clery Act, and VAWA.\n93 \nThe final regulations retain the \nproposed rules’ definition of ‘‘quid pro quo’’ harassment in the definition of sexual harassment.\n94The Department \nrecognized quid pro quo sexual \nharassment in its 1997 Guidance and 2001 Guidance, and cited to court cases that recognized quid pro quo sexual harassment under Title IX.\n95 \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230037 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \n96Janet Napolitano, ‘‘Only Yes Means Yes’’: An \nEssay on University Policies Regarding Sexual \nViolence and Sexual Assault, 33 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 387, 388 (2015). \n97Id. \n98Meritor Sav.

See Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson , 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) . Under \nthese final regulations, quid pro quo harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking do \nnot require a showing of alteration of the educational environment.

The Department does not dispute commenters’ \ncharacterization that only serious situations will be actionable under this definition, but following the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Davis , that stricture is appropriate in educational environments \nwhere younger students are still learning social skills and older students benefit from robust exchange of ideas, opinions, and beliefs. \nContrary to commenters’ assertions, neither the Davis standard nor the sexual harassment \ndefinition holistically gives a green light to inappropriate behavior. Rather, the three-pronged \ndefinition of sexual harassment in § 106.30 provides clear requirements for recipients to respond to sexual harassment that constitutes sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, while leaving \nrecipients flexibility to address other forms of misconduct to the degree, and in the manner, best suited to each recipient’s unique educational environment. \nThe Department agrees with commenters that for decades, sexual harassment has been a \nrecog nized form of sex discrimination that impedes equal access to education, and that rape and \nassault traumatize victims in ways that negatively affect participation in educational programs \nand activities. For this reason, contrary to the misunderstanding of many commenters, the \nDepartment intentionally included sexual assault as a per se type of sexual harassment rather \nthan leaving sexual assault to be evaluated for severity or pervasiveness under the Davis \nstandard. No student or employee traumatized by sexual assault need s to wonder whether a rape \nor sexual assault was “bad enough” or severe enough to report and expect a meaningful response from the survivor’s school, college, or university. Far from narrowing what constitutes sexual assault, the Department incorporates the offense of sexual assault used in the Clery Act, which \n432  \n    \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  \n  \n     \n \n \n  \n    \n  \n   \n  \n  \n      \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n          \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Although the withdrawn 2011 Dear Colleague \nLetter expressly disclaimed reliance on Davis , that guidance also stated that “The more severe the conduct, the less \nneed there is to show a repetitive series of incidents to prove a hostile environment, particularly if the harassment is \nphysical.

A formal complaint cannot be filed by telephone, because a formal complaint consists of a written document (or electronic submission, such as an e- mail or use of \nan online portal provided by the recipient for the purpose of accepting formal complaints) ; \nhowever, “any additional method designated by the recipient” may include an online submission \nsystem , and the final regulations now expressly reference the option for recipients to offer online \nportals for submission of formal complaints . The Department has also revised § 106.8(b) to \nspecify that the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coo rdinator under § \n106.8(a) must be prominently displayed on the recipient’s website (if the recipient has a website) \nand in any of the recipient’s handbooks or catalogs. As discussed above, neither the proposed \nrules, nor the final regulations, restrict the form in which notice (e.g., a report of alleged sexual \nharassment) is given to the Title IX Coordinator, an official with authority to institute corrective \nmeasures, or an elementary or secondary school employee. Such notice may be given to the Title IX Coordinator via the same contact information listed for the Title IX Coordinator in § 106.8(a) (including in person or by mail at the Title IX Coordinator’s office address, by telephone, or by \n408  \n    \n    \n    \n \n  \n   \n   \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n        \n  \n \n \n          \n              \n           \n                \n    \n            \n              \n              \n                 \n            \n                 \n            \n           \n             \n        \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The revisions to § 106.30 \ndefining “formal complaint” give complainants the options of filing a formal complaint in \nperson, by mail, by e-mail, and “any additional method designated by the recipient” so that the \nrecipient has discretion to designate other methods for a formal complaint to be filed; further, a \n“document filed by a complainant” is stated to mean a mean a document or electronic \nsubmission (such as by electronic mail or through an online portal provided for this purpose by the recipient) that contains the complainant’s physical or digi tal signature or otherwise indicates \n604 Section 106.8(a) (expressly stating that any person may report sexual harassment by using any of the listed \ncontact information for the Title IX Coordinator or by any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator \nreceiving the person’s verbal or written report, and such a report may be made “at any time (including during non -\nbusiness hours) by using the telephone number or electronic mail address, or by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX Coordinator.”). \n605 We also reiterate that any pers on may report sexual harassment triggering the recipient’s response obligations, \nalthough only a complainant (or Title IX Coordinator) may initiate a grievance process by filing or signing a formal complaint.', 'Because of the crucial role of Title IX \nCoordinators, the final regulations update and strengthen the requirements that recipients notify students, employees, parents of elementary and secondary school students, and others, of the Title IX Coordinator’s contact information and about how to make a report or file a formal complaint.\n527In \nfurther response to commenters’ concerns that students may not know how to contact a Title IX Coordinator, the final regulations require the Title IX Coordinator’s contact information (which must include an office address, telephone number, and email address) to be posted on recipients’ websites,\n528 \nexpressly state that any person may report sexual harassment using the listed contact information for the Title IX Coordinator or any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the person’s verbal or written report, specify that such a report may be made ‘‘at any time (including during non-business hours)’’ using the Title IX Coordinator’s listed telephone number or email address.\n529The final \nregulations also revise the definition of ‘‘formal complaint’’ to specify that a formal complaint may be filed in person, by mail, or by email using the listed contact information for the Title IX Coordinator.\n530The Department’s \nintent is to increase the likelihood that students and employees know how to contact, and receive supportive measures and accurate information from, a trained Title IX Coordinator.\n531 \nRequiring the contact information for a Title IX Coordinator to include an office address, email address, and telephone number pursuant to § 106.8(a) obviates some commenters’ concerns that complainants will need to travel to physically report in person or face-to- face with a Title IX Coordinator.\n532 \nThus, even if the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator is located on a different campus from the student or in an administrative building outside the school building where a student attends classes, any person may report to the Title IX Coordinator using the Title IX Coordinator’s listed contact information, providing accessible reporting options.\n533The Department believes \nthese requirements concerning a Title IX Coordinator are sufficient to hold recipients accountable for complying with these final regulations, while leaving recipients flexibility to decide, in a recipient’s discretion, whether designation of multiple Title IX Coordinators, or deputy Title IX Coordinators, might be necessary and where any Title IX office(s) should be located, given a recipient’s needs in terms of enrollment, geographic campus locations, and other factors. \nChanges: Section 106.8(a) is revised to \nrequire that recipients must not only designate, but also ‘‘authorize’’ a Title IX Coordinator to coordinate the recipient’s Title IX obligations. This provision is also revised to require recipients to notify students, employees, parents of elementary and secondary school students, and others, of the Title IX Coordinator’s contact information including office address, telephone number, and electronic mail address and to state that any person may report to the Title IX Coordinator using the contact information listed for the Title IX Coordinator (or any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the person’s verbal or written report). This provision is also revised to \nstate that a report may be made at any time (including during non-business hours) by using the telephone number or email address or by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX Coordinator. Section 106.8(b)(2) is revised to require the contact information for Title IX Coordinator(s) to be prominently displayed on the recipient’s website and in each of the recipient’s handbooks or catalogs. \nMiscellaneous Comments and Questions \nComments: One commenter \nrecommended that the final sentence of \n§ 106.30 be deleted, and that the word ‘‘apparent’’ be inserted before ‘‘authority’’ in the first sentence of the same provision. \nOne commenter asked whether a Title \nIX Coordinator can initiate a grievance process in the absence of a signed \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230119 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \n534The last sentence of § 106.30 defining ‘‘actual \nknowledge’’ to which a commenter referred, is now \nthe second to last sentence in that section in the final regulations and provides: ‘‘The mere ability or obligation to report sexual harassment or to inform a student about how to report sexual harassment, or having been trained to do so, does not qualify an individual as one who has authority to institute \ncorrective measures on behalf of the recipient.’’ (Emphasis added.

At the same \ntime, the se final regulations expressly state that no party’s advisor of choice, and no advisor \nprovided to a party by a recipient, needs to be an attorney, furthering the Department’s intent that the § 106.45 grievance process is suitable for implementation in an educational institution without trying to mimic a court trial. \nThe Department agrees with commenters that Federal case law is split on the specific \nissue of whether constitutional due process, or basic fairness under a contract theory between a private college and student, requires live cross- examination in sexual misconduct proceedings. \nThe Department disagrees that § 106.45(b)(6)(i) represents overreach, violations of federalism, administrative law, or rule of law, and contends instead that the final regulations prescribe a grievance process carefully tailored to be no more prescriptive than necessary to (1) be consistent with constitutional due process and fundamental fairness, even if § 106.45 includes procedures \nthat exceed minimal guarantees, and (2) address the challenges inherent in resolving sexual \nharassment allegations so that recipients are effectively held responsible for redressing sex discrimination in the form of sexua l harassment in recipients’ education programs or activities. \nAs noted elsewhere in this preamble, when a recipient draws conclusions about whether sexual harassment occurred in its education program or activity, the recipient is not merely making an \ninternal, private decision about its own affairs; rather, the recipient is making determinations that implicate the recipient’s obligation to comply with a Federal civil rights law that requires a recipient to operate education programs or activities free from sex discrimination. The \nDepartment therefore has regulatory authority to prescribe a framework for consistent, reliable determinations regarding responsibility for sexual harassment under Title IX. \n1110  \n   \n   \n   \n  \n \n  \n   \n    \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n   \n    \n   \n  \n    \n \n     \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The fact that some States already require public universities to allow cross -examination demonstrates that the concept is \nfamiliar to many recipients. The Department is regulating only as far as necessary to enforce the Federal ci vil rights law at issue; the final regulations govern only student and employee \nmisconduct that constitutes sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment under Title IX, and does not purport to require postsecondary institutions to utilize cross- exam ination in non-\nTitle IX matters.', 'According to this commenter, such schools would invite OCR complaints or lawsuits by respondents alleging that their Title IX rights under the proposed regulations had been violated.

Instead, these final \nregulations will provide consistency and clarity as to what a recipient’s obligations are under \nTitle IX and how a recipient must respond to allegations of sexual harassment under Title IX . \nThese final regulations provide a recipient d iscretion through the deliberate indifference standard \nin § 106.44(a) and through other provisions such as the provision in § 106.44(b) that the Assistant Secretary will not second -guess the recipient’s determination regarding responsibility. \nThese final regulations do not establish a more complainant- hostile process for employee \nsexual harassment matters than other discrimination -related and employee misconduct matters \nthat may expose schools to potential Title VII liability for sex discrimination . These final \nregulations do not favor either complainants or respondents and require a recipient’s response to treat complainants and respondents equitably under § 106.44(a) and § 106.45(b)(1)(i) by offering a complainant supportive measures (or remedies where a determination of responsibility for \nsexual harassment has been made against the respondent) , and both § 106.44(a) and § \n106.45(b)(1)(i) preclude the  imposition of disciplinary sanctions or other actions that are not \nsupportive measures as defined in § 106.30, against a respondent unless the recipient first applies \na grievance process that complies with § 106.45. These final regulations do not require a recipient to violate Title VII, and the commenter does not explain how these final regulations may expose recipients to liability under Title VII for sex discrimination . Recipients should \ncomply with both Title VII and Title IX, to the extent that these laws apply, and nothing in these \nfinal regulations preclude s a recipient from complying with Title VII. \nThe Department appreciates the commenters’ concerns about a live hearing with cross-\nexamination that allows all relevant questions that the rape  shield provision in § 106.45(b)(6) \n1555  \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n      \n   \n \n  \n  \n  \n   \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

We have revised the § 106.30 definition of a ctual knowledge \n482 The Department recognizes the many examples pointed to by comment ers, of postsecondary institutions failing to \nrespond appropriately to notice of sexual harassment allegations when at least some university employees knew of \nthe alleged sexual harassment, resulting in some situations where serial predators victimized man y people. We note \nthat such failures by institutions occurred under the status quo; that is, under the Department’s approach to notice in \nthe Department’s guidance. In these final regulations, the Department aims to respect the autonomy of students at \npostsecondary institutions, while ensuring that such students (and employees) clearly understand how to report \nsexual harassment. We believe that the best way to avoid reports “falling through the cracks” or successfully being \n“swept under the rug” by postseco ndary institutions, is not to continue (as Department guidance did) to insist that all \npostsecondary institutions must have universal or near -universal mandatory reporting.', 'v.

These final regulations ensure that all students and employees are notified of the contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and how to report sexual harassment for purposes of triggering a recipient’s response obligations, and the Department believes that students at postsecondary institutions benefit from retaining control over whether, and when, the complainant wants the recipient to respond to the sexual harassment that the complainant experienced . \nIn both the elementary and secondary school context and the postsecondary institution \ncontext, t he final regulations use the same broad conception of what might constitute “notice” as \nthe Department’s guidance used .

In the \npostsecondary institution context, the Department believes that complainants will benefit from allowing postsecondary institutions to decid e which of their employees (aside from the Title IX \nCoordinator, and officials with authority) may listen to a student’s disclosure of sexual harassment without being mandated to report the sexual harassment incident to the Title IX Coordinator. \nA recipient  (including a postsecondary institution recipient) may give authority to as \nmany officials as it wishes to institute corrective measures on behalf of the recipient , and notice \nto such officials with authority will trigger the recipient’s response obligations . A recipient also \nmay choose to train employees and other individuals, such as parent or alumni volunteers, on \nhow to report or respond to sexual harassment, even if these employees and individuals do not have the authority to take corrective measures on the recipient’s behalf . The Department will not \npenalize recipients for such tra ining by declaring that having trained people results in notice to \nthose people charging the recipient with actual knowledge . The Department recognizes that \nrecipients may not engage in such training efforts if such efforts may increase the recipient’s \nliability.\n505 Accordingly, these final regulations specify in the definition of actual knowledge in § \n505 Id.

Upon reaching a determination that a respondent is responsible for sexual harassment, the final regulations do not restrict a recipient’s discretion to impose a disciplinary sanction against the respondent, including suspension, expulsion, or other removal from the recipient’s education program or activity. Section 106.44(c) allows recipients to address emergency situations, whether or not a grievance process is underway, provided that the recipient first undertakes an individualized safety and risk analysis and provides the respondent notice and opportunity to challenge the removal decision. We do not believe it is necessary to restrict a recipient’s emergency removal authority to removal decisions that are ‘‘narrowly tailored’’ to address the risk because § 106.44(c) adequately requires that the threat ‘‘justifies’’ the removal.

Similarly, we decline to require recipients to follow more prescriptive requirements to undertake an emergency removal (such as requiring that the assessment be based on objective evidence, current medical knowledge, or performed by a licensed evaluator). While such detailed requirements might apply to a recipient’s risk assessments under other laws, for the purposes of these final regulations under Title IX, the Department desires to leave as much flexibility as possible for recipients to address any immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual. Nothing in these final regulations precludes a recipient from adopting a policy or practice of relying on objective evidence, current medical knowledge, or a licensed evaluator when considering emergency removals under § 106.44(c). \nWe agree that emergency removal is \nnot appropriate in every situation where sexual harassment has been alleged, but only in situations where an individualized safety and risk analysis determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual justifies the removal, where the threat arises out of allegations of sexual harassment as defined in § 106.30. Because all the conduct that could constitute sexual harassment as defined in § 106.30 is serious conduct that jeopardizes a complainant’s equal access to education, we decline to limit emergency removals only to instances where a complainant has alleged sexual assault or rape, or to prohibit emergency removals where the sexual harassment allegations involve verbal harassment. A threat posed by a respondent is not necessarily measured solely by the allegations made by the complainant; we have revised § 106.44(c) to add the phrase ‘‘arising from the allegations of sexual harassment’’ to clarify that the threat justifying a removal could consist of facts and circumstances ‘‘arising from’’ the sexual harassment allegations (and ‘‘sexual harassment’’ is a defined term, under § 106.30). For example, if a respondent threatens physical violence against the complainant in response to the complainant’s allegations that the respondent verbally sexually harassed the complainant, the immediate threat to the complainant’s physical safety posed by the respondent may ‘‘arise from’’ the sexual harassment allegations. As a further example, if a respondent \nreacts to being accused of sexual harassment by threatening physical self- harm, an immediate threat to the respondent’s physical safety may ‘‘arise from’’ the allegations of sexual harassment and could justify an emergency removal.', 'A recipient may need  to undertake an emergency removal in order to fulfill its duty not \nto be deliberately indifferent under § 106.44(a) and protect the safety of the recipient’s \ncommunity , and § 106.44(c) permits recipients to remove respondents in emergency situations \nthat arise out of alle gations of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment as defined in § \n106.30. Emergency removal may be undertaken in addition to implementing supportive \nmeasures designed to restore or preserve a complainant’s equal access to education.958 While we \nrecognize that emergency removal may have serious consequences for a respondent , we decline \nto remove this provision because where a genuine emergency exists, recipients need the authority \nto remove a respondent while providing notice and opportunity for the respondent to challenge that decision.  \nThe Department does not believe that rushing all allegations of sexual harassment or \nsexual assault through expedited grievance procedures adequately promotes a fair grievance process, and forbidding an e mergency removal until conclusion of a grievance process (no matter \n958 Section 106.44(a) requires a recipient to offer supportive measures to every complainant, including by having the \nTitle IX Coordinator engage with the complainant in an int eractive process that takes into account the complainant’s \nwishes regarding available supportive measures. \n726  \n    \n  \n \n \n    \n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n     \n  \n \n   \n  \n   \n \n  \n   \n   \n  \n   \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The § 106.45 grievance process is designed to provide both parties with a prompt, fair investigation and adjudication likely to reach an accurate determination regarding the responsibility of the respondent for perpetrating sexual harassment. Emergency removal under § 106.44(c) is not a substitute for reaching a determination as to a \nrespondent’s responsibility for the sexual harassment allegations; rather, emergency removal is for the purpose of addressing imminent threats posed to any person’s physical health or safety, which might arise out of the sexual haras sment allegations.

Therefore, such egregious acts can be addressed even if they do not constitute sexual harassment under Title IX. With respect to an attempted rape, we \ndefine “sexual assault” in § 106.30 by reference to the Clery Act,\n777 which in turn defines sexual \nassault by reference to the FBI UCR,778 and the FBI has stated that the offense of  rape includes \nattempts to commit rape.779 \nThe Department disputes a commenter’s contention that the sexual assault definition in § \n106.30 lacks sufficient precision to capture sexual assault that occurs under what the commenter called “guilt -inducing ambiguity” or “gra y areas” often centered around whether the complainant \ngenuinely consented or only consented due to coercion. For reasons explained in the “Consent” subsection of the “ Section  106.30 Definitions” section of this preamble, the Department \nintentionally leaves recipients flexibility and discretion to craft their own definitions of consent (and related terms often used to describe the absence or negation of consent, such as coercion). \n777 Section 106.30 (defining “sexual harass ment” to include “Sexual assault” as “defined in 20 U.S.C. \n1092(f)(6)(A)(v)”). \n778 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v) (“The term ‘sexual assault’ means an offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible \nsex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”). \n779 U.S. Dep’t. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Inv estigation , UCR Offense Definitions (with respect to rape, “Attempts \nor assaults to commit rape are also included”), https://ucrdatatool.gov/offenses.cfm . \n541  \n  \n \n   \n \n      \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n     \n  \n   \n \n   \n \n \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R.', 'July 28, 2021), \nappeals pending\n (1st Cir.).The Department will\nno longer enforce this portion of the provision and any related statements in this document may not be relied upon.affirmative consent, waking up a lover with a kiss is sexual assault, as is every thrust if consent is \nnot somehow re-communicated in between. \nOne commenter expressed concern that some sexual assault laws say that “not saying no” \ncan be considered assault. One commenter argued that “overthinking” about sexual consent \ncauses men not to approach women as much, and the commenter stated this is not good for \nsociety because it causes educated folks not to approach each other. \nAnother commenter stated that while the idea of affirmative consent sounds good, in \npractice it seems as if colleges look at this as the responsibility of one person, usually the male; the commenter  suggested rebranding affirmative conse nt as affirmative communication , and \nrecommended that colleges make clear that both parties have a duty to seek consent, but also that \nboth parties are responsible for communicating discomfort or communicating if they do not want \nto proceed with sexual act ivity. \nOne commenter recommended that the Department address training standards for \ndecision-makers, including faculty, to address what commenters believed is shoddy research \nfrom dubious sources used in training materials that contributes to unjust decisions. The \ncommenter referenced training around topics such as the amount of inebriation that violates consent and situations in which both parties are too drunk to consent. \nOne commenter expressed concern that the proposed rules would permit the introduction \nof evidence regarding the complainant’s sexual history, when offered to prove consent.

The Depa rtment believes that the \ndefinition of what constitutes consent for purposes of sexual assault within a recipient’s \neducational community is a matter best left to the discretion of recipients, many of whom are \nunder S tate law requirements to apply particul ar definitions of consent for purposes of campus \nsexual misconduct policies. The Department’s focus in th ese final regulation s is on recipients’ \nresponse to sexual harassment when such conduct constitutes sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The Depa rtment believes that the definition of sexual assault used by the Federal \ngovernment for crime reporting purposes appropriately captures conduct that constitutes sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX, regardless of whether the “without the consent” element in certain \nsex offenses is as narrow as some S tate criminal laws define consent, or broader as some S tate \nlaws have required for use in campus sexual assault situations. Recipients may consider relevant State laws in adopting a definition of consent. For thes e reasons, the Department declines to \nimpose a federalized definition of consent for Title IX purposes, notwithstanding commenters who would like the Department to adopt an affirmative consent standard, a “no means no” standard, an implied consent doctrine , or definitions of terms commonly used to indicate the \nabsence or negation of consent (such as coercion, duress, or incapacity).']"

An advisor’s cross- examination ‘‘on behalf of that party’’ is satisfied where the advisor poses questions on a party’s behalf, which means that an assigned advisor could relay a party’s own questions to the other party or witness, and no particular skill or qualification is needed to perform that role. These changes in the final regulations similarly address commenters’ concerns that the assigned advisors need be ‘‘adverse’’ to or ‘‘pitted against’’ members of the recipient’s community. While an assigned advisor may have a personal or professional belief in, or dedication to, the position of the party on whose behalf the advisor conducts cross-examination, such a belief or dedication is not a requirement to function as the assigned advisor. Whether a party’s cross-examination is conducted by a party’s advisor of choice or by the advisor provided to that party by the recipient, the recipient itself remains neutral, including the decision- maker’s obligation to serve impartially and objectively evaluate relevant evidence. The Department emphasizes that advisors of choice, and advisors provided to a party by the recipient, are not subject to the requirements of § 106.45(b)(1)(iii) which obligates Title IX personnel (Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and persons who facilitate informal resolutions) to serve impartially without conflicts of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or for or against an individual complainant or respondent. \nThe Department understands \ncommenters’ point that educational processes have been designed to let the voices and perspectives of the parties be heard, and not the voices and perspectives of third-party advisors. For reasons described above and in § 106.45(b)(5)(iv), the Department believes that giving each party the opportunity to be assisted and supported by an advisor of choice yields important benefits to both parties participating in a grievance process. The final regulations carefully balance the right of parties to rely on and be assisted by advisors with the interest of an educational institution in focusing the institution’s process on the institution’s own students and employees rather than on third parties. The final regulations allow recipients to limit the active participation of advisors, with the one exception in § 106.45(b)(6)(i) that an advisor must conduct cross-examination on behalf of a party. As noted above, the Department believes that the risks of allowing personal confrontation between parties in sexual harassment cases outweigh the downsides of allowing advisors to actively participate in the limited role of conducting cross- examination. \nThe Department understands \ncommenters’ assertions that many recipient’s employees will not wish to serve as party advisors because they do not want to be viewed as supporting or assisting one party over the other. The Department notes that § 106.45(b)(6)(i) applies only to postsecondary institutions, and institutions of higher education that receive Federal student aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, already must comply with the Clery Act, which permits parties to have advisors of choice, and commenters have noted that many recipients’ practice is to allow parties to choose advisors from among recipient employees, and that some recipients already provide advisors to parties. For the reasons explained above, these final regulations do not change that landscape qualitatively, because even conducting cross-examination ‘‘on behalf of a party’’ need not mean more than relaying that party’s questions to the other parties and witnesses. That function could therefore equate to serving as a party’s proxy, or advocating for a party, or neutrally relaying the party’s desired questions; this provision leaves recipients and assigned advisors wide latitude in deciding how to fulfill the role of serving as an assigned advisor. For the same reason, the Department does not believe it is necessary to forbid assigned advisors from being persons who exercise any administrative or academic authority over the other party; \nassigned advisors are not obligated to avoid conflicts of interest and can fulfill the limited role described in § 106.45(b)(6)(i) regardless of the scope of the advisor’s other duties as a recipient’s employee. \nFor reasons described above, the \nDepartment retains the requirement for recipients to provide parties with an advisor to conduct cross-examination, instead of merely requiring recipients to advise a party about how to select an advisor. In order to foreclose personal confrontation between the parties during cross-examination while preserving the neutrality of the recipient’s decision-maker, that procedure must be conducted by advisors rather than by parties, and where a party does not take the opportunity to select an advisor of the party’s choice, that choice falls to the recipient.', '§ 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

However, the Department does not wish to impose burdens and \ncosts on recipients beyond what is necessary to achieve a Title IX grievance process with robust procedural protections leading to a reliable outcome. The Department believes that giving both parties equal opportunity to select advisors of choice, who may be, but are not required to be \nattorneys, and assuring parties who cannot or do not select their own advisor that the party can still accomplish cross -examination at a hearing because the recipi ent will provide an advisor for \nthat limited purpose, sufficiently achieves the purpose of a Title IX grievance process without imposing additional burdens on recipients to hire attorneys for the parties. Nothing in the final \nregulations precludes a recipi ent from offering to provide attorney representation or non-attorney \nadvisors to both parties throughout the entire grievance process or just for a live hearing, though \n§ 106.45(b)(5)(iv) ensures that parties would retain the right to select their own advisor of choice \nand refuse any such offer by a recipient.', 'To allow recipients to meet their obligations with as much flexibility as possible, the Department declines to require recipients to pre -screen a panel \nof assigned advisors from which a party could make a selection at a hearing, or to require provided advisors to receive training from the recipient.

This provision does not impose an unfunded mandate on recipients because recipients retain discretion whether to incur the cost of hiring attorney or non-attorney advisors. \nThe Department does not believe that the final regulations’ expectation for an advisor to \n“conduct cross- examination on behalf of a party” constitutes the practice of law; a Title IX \nadjudication is not a civil or criminal trial so the advisor is not representing a party in a court of law, and the advisor is not required to perform any function beyond relaying a party’s desired questions to the other party and witnesses. However, to the extent that a recipient is concerned that State bar associations do, or may, consider party advisors at a live hearing to be practicing law, the recipient retains discretion to select attorneys as assigned party advisors. Whether attorneys become more involved in Title IX adjudications as a result is not the Department’s \nconcern; the final regulations focus on those procedural protections necessary to ensure that a \nTitle IX grievance process is designed to reach accurate determinations. \nThe Department bel ieves that § 106.45(b)(6)(i) , as revised in the final regulations, \naddresses commenters’ concerns that parties will challenge the outcome based on the recipient’s choice of advisor. This provision clarifies that the choice of advisor where one must be provided by the recipient lies in the recipient’s sound discretion, and removes the “aligned with that party” criterion so that a party cannot challenge the recipient’s choice by claiming the assigned advisor was not sufficiently aligned. Whether or not the re cipient complied with this provision is now \nmore objectively determined, i.e., by observing whether the assigned advisor “conducted cross-examination on behalf of the party” which in essence only needs to mean relaying the party’s \n1151  \n   \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n    \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n   \n \n  \n    \n \n \n              \n                  \n          \n             \n            \n                \n          \n            \n           \n     \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Commenters requested clarification as to whether by filing a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator becomes a party in the investigation, and if this means that the Title IX Coordinator must be given the rights that the grievance procedures give to complainants, or if not, then commenters wondered who would be treated as the complainant in cases where the victim did not sign the formal complaint. Commenters argued that a Title IX Coordinator who signs a formal complaint initiating grievance procedures against a respondent is no longer neutral or impartial, is biased, and/or has a conflict of interest, especially where the Title IX Coordinator will also be the investigator. \nDiscussion: We appreciate the \nopportunity to clarify that the final regulations do not permit a formal complaint to be filed or signed by any person other than the complainant (i.e., the person alleged to be the victim of sexual harassment or the alleged victim’s parent or guardian on the alleged victim’s behalf, as appropriate) or the Title IX Coordinator. While it is true that school administrators other than the Title IX Coordinator may have significant interests in ensuring that the recipient investigate potential violations of school policy, for reasons explained above, the decision to initiate a grievance process in situations where the complainant does not want an investigation or where the complainant intends not to participate should be made thoughtfully and intentionally, taking into account the circumstances of the situation including the reasons why the complainant wants or does not want the recipient to investigate. The Title IX Coordinator is trained with special responsibilities that involve interacting with complainants, making the Title IX Coordinator the appropriate person to decide to initiate a grievance process on behalf of the recipient. Other school \nadministrators may report sexual harassment incidents to the Title IX Coordinator, and may express to the Title IX Coordinator reasons why the administrator believes that an investigation is warranted, but the decision to initiate a grievance process is one that the Title IX Coordinator must make.\n595 \nThe Department does not view a Title \nIX’s Coordinator decision to sign a formal complaint as being adverse to the respondent. A Title IX Coordinator’s decision to sign a formal complaint is made on behalf of the recipient (for instance, as part of the recipient’s obligation not to be deliberately indifferent to known allegations of sexual harassment), not in support of the complainant or in opposition to the respondent or as an indication of whether the allegations are credible, have merit, or whether there is evidence sufficient to determine responsibility. To clarify this, we have removed the phrase ‘‘or on whose behalf the Title IX Coordinator has filed a formal complaint’’ from the proposed rules’ definition of ‘‘complainant’’ in § 106.30. We have also revised the § 106.30 definition of ‘‘formal complaint’’ to state that when the Title IX Coordinator signs a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator does not become a complainant, or otherwise a party, to a grievance process, and must still serve free from bias or conflict of interest for or against any party. \nIn order to ensure that a recipient has \ndiscretion to investigate and adjudicate allegations of sexual harassment even without the participation of a complainant, in situations where a grievance process is warranted, the final regulations leave that decision in the discretion of the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator. However, deciding that allegations warrant an investigation does not necessarily show bias or prejudgment of the facts for or against the complainant or respondent.

Commenters asked whether a recipient would be deliberately indifferent if the recipient failed to tell a complainant who intended to file a formal complaint that the document filed failed to meet the requirements in § 106.30 and thus no grievance procedures had begun. Commenters requested clarification as to how a Title IX Coordinator should treat an “informal complaint” that did not meet the precise definition of a formal complaint.  Commenters argued \nthat the definition of “formal complaint” means that a recipient could dismiss a meritorious \ncomplaint, or refuse to investigate, solely for immaterial technical reasons, such as the document \nnot being signed or failing to include specific language “requesting i nitiation” of the grievance \nprocedures. Commenters argued that the definition of “formal complaint” would provide an \narbitrary bureaucratic loophole that would excuse recipients for their willful indifference when \npaperwork is not completed perfectly.', 'The Title IX \nCoordinator is trained with special responsibilities that involve interacting with complainants , \nmaking the Title IX Coordinator the appropriate person to decide to initiate a grievance process \non behalf of the recipient.

Comments : Some commenters discussed current § 106.12, as well as the practice of OCR. \nCommenters stated that the status quo requires a religious institution to affirmatively request an exemption, and that imposing such a duty inappropriately places the burden on religious educational institutions. Instead, the commenters suggested, the burden would more appropriately be placed on the government, by having to disprove the application of a religious \nexemption. Indeed, commenters suggested that the status quo could occasionally be turned against religious educational institutions, by denying religious exemptions or forcing schools to wait an excessively long period of time before obtaining a letter of assurance from OCR . \nDiscussion : Contrary to commenters who suggested that the status quo requires schools to \naffirmatively request an assurance le tter from OCR , OCR has previously interpreted the current \nregulation to mean that a school can invoke a religious exemption even after OCR has received a complaint regarding the educational institution. Additionally, the Department views both the status qu o and the final regulations to require a recipient to invoke and establish its eligibility for \nan exemption, and does not view the final regulations as placing the burden on the Federal government to disprove any claim for religious exemption . However, it may be correct that many \nschools and individuals —such as these commenters themselves—have incorrectly read current § \n106.12 to mean that a recipient must always seek or receive an assurance letter from OCR  to \nassert the religious exemption before any compl aint is filed against the school, if a religious \nexemption is to be invoked.

Of course, a recipient must know what it is under investigation for, in order to assert an applicable exemption such as a religious exemption. Nonetheless, a recipient cannot invoke a religious exemption “at the last minute” because the recipient must be an educational \ninstitution which is controlled by a religious organization, and such control by a religious organization is not something that occurs “at the last minute.” The educational ins titution must \nhave been controlled by a religious organization when the alleged noncompliance occurred, and the educational institution is only exempt from Title IX and these final regulations to the extent that Title IX or these final regulations are not consistent with the religious tenets of such \norganization. \nAdditionally, retaliation is strictly prohibited under § 106.71, and a recipient cannot \ninvoke a religious exemption to retaliate against a person. Similarly, a recipient may only assert an exempti on to the extent that Title IX or these regulations are not consistent with the religious \ntenets of the religious organization that controls an educational institution. \nThe Department is not aware of any assumption that all educational institutions which a re \ncontrolled by a religious organization engage in discriminatory practices, and the Department’s \n1660  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n      \n  \n   \n     \n   \n  \n \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Drawing on this fact, commenters noted that the freedom of religion has been a \ntouchstone of Ame rican government since the country was founded. Other  commenter s stated \nthat proposed § 106.12(b) is consistent with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, since it \navoids placing an unnecessary burden on religious institutions. Some commenters noted that proposed § 106.12(b)  has the ancillary benefit of avoiding confusion for schools, since many \ninstitutions may not obtain a religious exemption before having a complaint against them filed, but now they will know that there is no such duty. The corollary to this point, asserted commenters, is that opponents of a school’s religious exemption may not incorrectly argue that a school has “waived” a right to invoke a religious exemption. Discussion : The Department appreciates and agrees with the comments in supp ort of § \n106.12(b), which align with the Title IX statute, the First Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1. The final regulations bring § 106.12(b) further in \nline with the relevant statutory framework in this context, which states that Title IX “shall not \napply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization,” 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(3), and that the term “program or activity,” as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1687, “does not include any operation of an entity which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of section 1681 of this title to such operation would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.” \nNo part of the statute requires that recipients receive an assurance letter from OCR, and \nno part of the statute suggests that a recipien t must be publicly on the record as a religious \ninstitution claiming a religious exemption before it may invoke a religious exemption in the context of Title IX .

While it may be helpful or useful for recipients to consider factors \napplied by Federal courts to determine the scope of a recipient’s program or activity, no single factor is determinative  to conclude whether a recipient exercised substantial control over the \nrespondent and the context in which the harassment occurred, or whether an incident occurred as \npart of “all of the operations of” a school, college, or university. \nThe revised language in § 106.44(a) also specifically addresses commenters’ concerns \nabout recognized student organizations that own and control buildings such as some fraternities \nand sororities operating from off -campus locations where sexual harassment and assault may \noccur with freq uency. The revised language further addresses commenters’ questions regarding \nwhether postsecondary institutions’ Title IX obligations are triggered when sexual harassment \noccurs in an off -campus location not owned by the postsecondary institution but that is in use by \na student organization that the institution chooses to officially recognize such as a fraternity or \nsorority.

Nothing in the final regulations prohibits a recipient from resolving allegations of conduct outside the recipient’s education program or activity by applying the same grievance process required under § 106.45 for formal complaints of Title IX sexual harassment, even though such a process would not be required under Title IX or these final regulations. Thus, a recipient is not required by these final regulations to inefficiently extricate conduct occurring outside an education program or activity from conduct occurring in an education program or activity arising from the same facts or circumstances in order to meet the recipient’s obligations with respect to the latter. \nThe Department appreciates the \nvarious concerns raised by many commenters regarding the extent to which students reside or spend time off campus and how the application of the ‘‘education program or activity’’ condition may affect students who experience sexual harassment and sexual assault in off-campus situations, including community college students, vocational school students, and students who belong to marginalized demographic groups. The Department reiterates that the final regulations do not impose a geographic test or draw a distinction between on-campus misconduct and off-campus misconduct. As discussed above, whether conduct occurs in a recipient’s education program or activity does not necessarily depend on the geographic location of the incident. Instead, ‘‘education program or activity’’ relies on statutory and regulatory definitions of ‘‘program or activity,’’\n872on the \nstatement adapted from the Supreme Court’s language in Davis added to \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00174 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230199 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \n873As discussed in the ‘‘Directed Question 5: \nIndividuals with Disabilities’’ subsection of the \n‘‘Directed Questions’’ section of this preamble, nothing in these final regulations affects a recipient’s obligations to comply with all applicable disability laws, such as the ADA. Thus, for example, if a recipient’s student (or employee) has a disability caused or exacerbated by, or arising from, sexual harassment, a recipient must comply with applicable disability laws (including with respect to providing reasonable accommodations) irrespective of whether the sexual harassment that caused or exacerbated the individual’s disability constitutes Title IX sexual harassment to which the recipient must respond under these final regulations. 874See, e.g., Lapka v. Chertoff, 517 F.3d 974, 982– \n83 (7th Cir. 2008). \n875The Department adds to § 106.44(a) the \nstatement that ‘‘education program or activity’’ \nincludes locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the harassment occurs. This helps clarify that even if a situation arises off campus, it may still be part of the recipient’s education program or activity if the recipient exercised substantial control over the context and the alleged harasser. While such situations may be fact specific, recipients must consider whether, for example, a sexual harassment \nincident between two students that occurs in an off- campus apartment (i.e., not a dorm room provided \nby the recipient) is a situation over which the recipient exercised substantial control; if so, the recipient must respond when it has actual knowledge of sexual harassment or allegations of sexual harassment that occurred there. At the same time, the Title IX statute and existing regulations broadly define a recipient’s ‘‘program or activity’’ to include (as to schools) ‘‘all of the operations’’ of the school, such that situations that arise on campus are already part of a school’s education program or activity. 20 U.S.C. 1687. § 106.44(a) that education program or \nactivity includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over the respondent and over the context in which the sexual harassment occurred, and includes on-campus and off-campus buildings owned or controlled by a student organization officially recognized by a postsecondary institution.', 'For example, the 2001 Guidance notes that ‘‘Title IX applies to all public and private educational institutions that receive Federal funds’’ and states that the ‘‘education program or activity of a school includes all of the school’s operations’’ which means ‘‘that Title IX protects students in connection with all of the academic, educational, extra- curricular, athletic, and other programs of the school, whether they take place in the facilities of the school, on a school bus, at a class or training program sponsored by the school at another location, or elsewhere.’’\n882 \nSimilarly, the 2017 Q&A expressly acknowledges that a recipient’s obligation to respond to sexual harassment is confined to harassment that occurs in the recipient’s education program or activity, citing statutory and regulatory definitions of ‘‘recipient,’’ ‘‘operations,’’ and ‘‘program or activity.’’\n883The final regulations \nsimilarly rely on preexisting statutory and regulatory definitions of a recipient’s ‘‘program or activity’’ and add a statement that ‘‘education program or activity’’ includes circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control. The withdrawn 2011 Dear Colleague Letter departed from the Department’s longstanding acknowledgement that a recipient’s response obligations are conditioned on sexual harassment that occurs in the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity;\n884these final regulations return to the Department’s \napproach in the 2001 Guidance, which mirrors the Supreme Court’s approach to ‘‘education program or activity’’ as a jurisdictional condition that promotes a recipient’s obligation under Title IX to provide education programs or activities free from sex discrimination. Like the 2001 Guidance, the final regulations approach the ‘‘education program or activity’’ condition as extending to circumstances over which recipients have substantial control, and not only to incidents that occur ‘‘on campus.’’ We reiterate that nothing in the final regulations precludes a recipient from offering supportive measures to a complainant who reports sexual harassment that occurred outside the recipient’s education program or activity, and any sexual harassment that does occur in an education program or activity must be responded to even if it relates to, or happens subsequent to, sexual harassment that occurred outside the education program or activity. \nAlthough the 2001 Guidance and \n2017 Q&A frame actionable sexual harassment as harassment that creates a ‘‘hostile environment,’’\n885the final \nregulations utilize the more precise interpretation of Title IX’s scope articulated by the Supreme Court in Davis: That a recipient must respond to \nsexual harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education.\n886The use of the \nphrase ‘‘hostile environment’’ in the 2001 Guidance and 2017 Q&A does not mean that those guidance documents ignored the ‘‘education program or activity’’ limitation referenced in the \nTitle IX statute; whether framed as a ‘‘hostile environment’’ (as in Department guidance) or as ‘‘effective denial of a person’s equal access’’ to education (as in these final regulations), sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination actionable under Title IX when it occurs in an education program or activity. \nBecause the final regulations do not \nexclude ‘‘off campus’’ sexual harassment from coverage under Title IX and instead take the approach utilized in the 2001 Guidance and applied by the Supreme Court in Davis, under which off campus sexual harassment may be in the scope of a recipient’s education program or activity, the Department disagrees that these final regulations conflict with the Department’s recent enforcement action with respect to holding Chicago Public Schools accountable for failure to appropriately respond to certain off- campus sexual assaults. \nChanges: Section 106.44(a) is revised \nto state that ‘‘education program or activity’’ includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which \nthe harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution. Section 106.45(b)(1)(iii) is revised to include training for Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and persons who facilitate informal resolutions on ‘‘the scope of the recipient’s education program or activity.’’ Section 106.45(b)(3)(i) is revised to expressly provide that a mandatory dismissal of allegations in a formal complaint about conduct not occurring in the recipient’s education program or activity is ‘‘for purposes of title IX or [34 CFR part 106]; such a dismissal does not preclude action under another provision of the recipient’s code of conduct.’’ Section 106.45(b)(10)(i)(D) is revised to require recipients to post materials used to train Title IX personnel on the recipient’s website, or if the recipient does not have a website, to make such materials available for inspection and review by members of the public.']"

To clarify the intent of this provision, we have revised § 106.45(b)(9) to \nstate that recipients may not offer informal resolution unless a formal complaint has been filed. \nAt the same time, the Department is persuaded by some commenters who expressed \nconcern that it may be too difficult to ensure that mediation or other informal resolution is truly \nvoluntary on the part of students who report being sexually harassed by a recipient’s  employee, \ndue to the power differential and potential for undue influence or pressure exerted by an employee over a student. For this reason, the Department has revised  § 106.45(b)(9)( iii) to state \nthat recipients cannot offer an informal resolution process to resolve formal complaints alleging \nthat an employee sexually harassed a student . \nWith respect to informal resolution facilitators potentially serving as witnesses in \nsubsequent formal grievance processes, we leave this possibility open to recipients. If recipients were to accept such witnesses, then the Department would expect this possibility to be clearly disclosed to the parties as part of the § 106.45(b)(9)(i) requ irement in the final regulations to \nprovide a written notice disclosing any consequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including the records that will be maintained or could be shared.

Commenters stated that c alling this process “informal” can \ncause recipients to underestimate the training, skill, and preparation necessary to successfully \nexecute this resolution method, and it might also lead recipients to treat sexual misconduct \nclaims with greater skepticism than other misconduct.

Discussion : The final regulations do not specify the method of delivery for written notices and \ndisclosures required under the final regulations, including the method by which the recipient \nmust obtain parties’ voluntary written conse nt to informal resolution . The Department \nacknowledges the potential convenience, privacy, and security benefits of shifting from physical disclosures and signatures to electronic disclosures and signatures but leaves recipients with discretion as to the method of delivery of written notices under § 106.45(b)(9). Changes : None. \nExpulsion Through Informal Resolution \nComments : One commenter argued that expulsion is an inappropriate sanction for informal \nresolution, and the Department should prohibit schools from expelling students through informal resolution to ensure a fair process for all. \n1389  \n   \n  \n   \n   \n     \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n   \n   \n  \n   \n     \n \n \n \n   \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

July 28, 2021), \nappeals pending\n (1st Cir.).The Department will\nno longer enforce this portion of the provision and any related statements in this document may not be relied upon.Discussion : The Department believes that the robust disclosure requirements of § 106.45(b)(9), \nthe requirement that both parties provide voluntary written consent to informal resolution, and \nthe explicit right of either party to withdraw from the informal resolution process at any time prior to agreeing to the resolution (which may or may not include expulsion of the respondent), will adequately protect the respondent’s interest in a fair process before the sanction of expulsion \nis imposed . Accordingly, the Department believes that prohibiting recipients from using informal \nresolution where it results in expulsion is unnecessary; if expulsion is the sanction proposed as part of an informal resolution process, that result can only occur if both parties agree to the \nresolution . If a respondent, for example, does not believe that expulsion is appropriate then the \nrespondent can withdraw from the informal resolution process and resume the formal grievance process under which the recipient must complete a fair investigation and adjudication, render a \ndetermination regarding responsibility, and only then decide on any disciplinary sanction .  \nChanges : None. \nClarification Requests \nComments : Several commenters raised questions regarding the informal resolution provisions of \nthe NPRM . One commenter inqui red as to whether a time frame could apply after which neither \nparty could ask for an ongoing informal resolution process to be set aside and proceed with formal investigation and adjudication . One commenter raised concerns regarding recipients’ \nlegal liab ility if the informal resolution process included a respondent’s acknowledgement of a \npolicy violation, but the respondent was allowed to remain on campus and violated that same policy again. One commenter sought clarification as to whether informal resolution could \ninclude a respondent taking responsibility and accepting disciplinary action without any meeting or process at all .

The Department acknowledges the concerns \nexpressed by these commenters, and the final regulations go a step further than the NPRM by \nexplicitly pr ohibiting recipients from requiring the parties to participate in an informal resolution \nprocess, and expressly forbidding recipients from making participation in informal resolution a condition of admission or employment, or enjoyment of any other right. We wish to emphasize \nthat consent to informal resolution cannot be the product of coercion or undue influence because \ncoercion or undue influence would contradict the final regulations’ prohibitions against a recipient “requiring” parties to participate in informal resolution, obtaining the parties’ \n“voluntary” consent, and/or conditioning “enjoyment of any other right” on participation in \ninformal resolution . In addition, and as discussed above, the Department believes that by \nextending the robust training and impartiality requirements of § 106.45(b)(1)(iii) to individuals who facilitate informal resolutions, the perverse incentives and biases that may otherwise taint an \ninformal resolution process will be effectively countered . The Department believes these \nrequirements have the cumulative effect of ensuring that the parties’ consent to informal \nresolution is truly voluntary, and that no party is involuntarily denied the right to have sexual \nharassment allegations resolved through the investigation and adjudication process provided for \nby the final regulations. Indeed, we believe the cumulative effect of these requirements will help \nto ensure that parties’ consent to informal resolution is truly voluntary, and therefore we decline to mandate that the parties confer with an advisor before entering an informal resolution process, or to mandate that recipients provide the parties with advisors before entering an informal resolution process. \n1374  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n  \n    \n    \n   \n  \n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n     \n   \n \n    \n   \n \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Because the option of informal resolution rests on the premise \nthat no party is ever required to participate, and where each party voluntarily engages in informal \nresolution only because the party believes such a process may further the party’s own wishes and \ndesires, we have removed from the final regulations the option of informal resolution for any \nallegations that an employee sexually harassed a student. The final regulations leave recipients \ndiscretion to make informal resolution available as an option, or not, with respect to sexual harassment allegations other than when the formal complaint alleges that an employee sexually harassed a student. \nSubject to the modifications m ade in these final regulations, described above, t he \nDepartment believes that informal resolution empowers the parties by offering alternative \nconflict resolution systems that may serve their unique needs and provides greater flexibility to \nrecipients in serving their educational communities.']"

If a recipient allows parties to \nprovide additional evidence after reviewing the evidence under § 106.45(b)(5)(vi) , any such \nadditional evidence that is summarized in the investigative report will not qualify as new evidence that was reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility was made for purposes of an appeal under § 106.45(b)(8). \nThe Department agrees with the commenter’s concern that the investigative report shou ld \ncontain relevant evidence including exculpatory and inculpatory evidence.

The Department thus declines to remove the word “objective,” require recipients to adopt any jurisdiction’s rules of evidence, or add rules or presumptions that would require partic ular types of evidence to be relevant.  \nChanges : In the final regulations we add § 106.45(b)(1)(x), precluding the recipient from using \nevidence that would result in disclosure of information protected by a legally recognized \nprivilege. The final regulatio ns add language in § 106.45(b)(5)(vi) stating that evidence subject \nto inspection and review must include inculpatory and exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or from another source.

Several commenters believed this provision provides recipients with appropriate \nflexibility to decide the amount and type of training recipients must provide to individuals \ninvolved with Title IX proceedings.', 'A party may always request that the recipient not \nsend the investigative report to the  party’s advisor, but if the party has already indicated that the \nparty has selected an ad visor of choice then we believe the better default practice is for the \nparty’s advisor to be sent the investigative report, so that the burden of receiving the report, then \nforwarding it to the party’s advisor, does not rest on the party, which would also result in a de \nfacto  shortening of the ten-day window in which a party – with assistance from an advisor – may \nreview and prepare responses to the investigator’s summary of relevant evidence. \nThe Department acknowledges the difference between the use of “directly related to the \nallegations ” in § 106.45(b)(5)(vi) and “relevant evidence” in § 106.45(b)(5)(vii). As discussed \nabove, in th e “Section  106.45(b)(5)(vi) Inspection and Review of Evidence Directly Related to \nthe Allegations, and Directed Question 7” subsection of the “Investigation” subsection of the \n“Section  106.45 Recipient’s Response to Formal Complaints” section of this pream ble, we \nacknowledge that “directly related to the allegations” may encompass a broader universe of \nevidence than evidence that is “relevant,” and believe that it is most beneficial for the parties’ \naccess to evidence to be limited by what is directly related to the allegations, but for the investigator to determine what is relevant after the parties have reviewed that evidence. \nIndependent of whether this provision would be required to satisfy constitutional due \nprocess of law , § 106.45(b)(5)( vii) (giving the parties copies of the investigative report prior to \nthe live hearing or other time of determination) serves an important function in a Title IX grievance process, placing the parties on level footing with regard to accessing information to \nallow the parties to serve as a check on any decisions that the recipient makes regarding the relevance of evidence and omission of relevant evidence.

Additionally, the final regulations establish sufficient rights for ESE students to adequately defend themselves from accusations of sexual harassment, for example through the right to inspect and review all evidence directly related to the allegations including exculpatory evidence, whether obtained by a party or other source, the right to review the investigative report containing the recipient’s summary of relevant evidence, the right to an advisor of choice, and the right to pose written questions and follow-up questions to the other party and witnesses prior to a determination regarding responsibility being reached. At the same time, the foregoing procedural rights are granted equally to complainants, resulting in a truth-seeking grievance process that provides due process protections for all parties. \nNothing in the final regulations \nprevents recipients from facilitating informal resolution processes, including what commenters referred to as restorative justice processes, within the confines of § 106.45(b)(9). \nChanges: None. \nComments: Many commenters argued \nthat the Department’s Directed Question 1 was itself flawed, because it asked whether different rules ought to apply to different institutions that are ESE or PSE institutions, while many ESE students interact with PSE institutions in a variety of ways. Commenters noted that some PSE institutions run daycares, elementary and secondary school \nsporting enrichment programs, host high-school students for events, and even enroll high-school students in dual-enrollment courses at the PSE level. Several community colleges commented to say that they had numerous ESE students enrolled in their courses, and that many of these students came onto their campuses physically during the day.', 'Discussion: The Department \nappreciates this feedback. The Department agrees that schools must have effective tools for responding to allegations of sexual harassment, and the final regulations protect this interest. The final regulations are designed to promote predictability and a clear understanding of every recipient’s legal obligations to respond to sexual harassment incidents, including promptly offering supportive measures to a complainant (i.e., a \nperson alleged to be the victim of sexual harassment) whenever any ESE employee has notice of sexual harassment or allegations of sexual harassment. One of the ways in which these final regulations differentiate between ESE and PSE students is recognizing that ESE students cannot reasonably be expected to report sexual harassment only to certain school officials, or even teachers, and that ESE recipients and their employees stand in a special relationship regarding their students, captured by the legal doctrine that school districts act in loco parentis with respect to authority over, and responsibility for, their students. Thus, the final regulations (at § 106.30 defining ‘‘actual knowledge’’) trigger an ESE recipient’s response obligations any time an ESE employee has notice of sexual harassment. These final regulations obligate all recipients to promptly reach out to each complainant (i.e., a person alleged to be the victim of \nconduct that could constitute sexual harassment, regardless of who actually witnessed or reported the sexual harassment) and offer supportive measures, under § 106.44(a). These final regulations (at § 106.6(g)) also expressly acknowledge the importance of respecting the legal rights of parents or guardians to act on behalf of students in a Title IX matter, including but not limited to the choice to file a formal complaint asking the school to investigate sexual harassment allegations. These final regulations define ‘‘supportive measures’’ in § 106.30 in a manner that gives ESE recipients wide discretion to quickly, \neffectively take steps to protect student safety, deter sexual harassment, and preserve a complainant’s equal educational access. As discussed in the ‘‘Supportive Measures’’ subsection of the ‘‘Section 106.30 Definitions’’ section of this preamble, supportive measures cannot ‘‘unreasonably burden’’ the respondent but this does not mean that supportive measures cannot place any burden on a respondent, so actions such as changing a respondent’s class or activity schedule may fall under permissible supportive measures, and supportive measures must be offered without waiting to see if a grievance process is eventually initiated or not. Recipients also retain the authority to remove a respondent from education programs or activities on an emergency basis if the respondent presents an imminent threat to the physical health or safety of any individual, under § 106.44(c). We also reiterate that many actions commonly taken in the ESE context are not restricted under these final regulations; while a recipient may not punish or discipline a respondent without complying with the § 106.45 grievance process, actions such as holding an educational conversation \nwith a respondent, explaining to the respondent in detail the recipient’s anti- sexual harassment policy and code of conduct expectations, and similar actions are not restricted unless paired with actions that are punitive, disciplinary, or unreasonably burdensome to the respondent. \nWe disagree that a presumption of \nnon-responsibility\n1731is less important \nfor respondents in the ESE context than in the PSE context, because the presumption serves to reinforce that a recipient must not treat a respondent as responsible for Title IX sexual harassment unless such allegations have been proved or otherwise resolved under a process that complies with § 106.45, but as discussed above, this leaves wide flexibility for recipients to address the need for complainants’ equal educational access, protect safety, and deter sexual harassment, while a grievance process is pending or without any grievance pending. \nChanges: None. \nComments: Many commenters argued \nthat the grievance procedures in the NPRM generally do not work well for ESE recipients.

The final regulations clearly specify which rights or interests could justify an opportunity to appeal; namely, where the outcome was affected by procedural irregularity, newly discovered evidence, or conflict of interest or bias in key personnel involved with the \ninvestigation and adjudication of the case. The Department also believes that giving recipients flexibility and discretion in crafting their Title IX processes is important, and we believe that recipients are in best position to know the unique values and interests of their educational communities. For this reason, § 106.45(b)(8) grants recipients discretion to offer appeals on additional grounds, so long as such additional bases for appeal are offered equally to both parties. \nWe respectfully disagree with the \ncommenters who argued that the final regulations should prohibit appeals of not responsible determinations because of double jeopardy concerns. As discussed above, we believe that both respondents and complainants face potentially life-altering consequences from the outcomes of Title IX proceedings. As such, it is important to protect complainants’ right to appeal as well as respondents’ right to appeal. We believe the final regulations adequately protect both parties’ interests in a fair, accurate outcome by requiring recipients to offer both parties the opportunity to appeal on at least three specific bases; requiring that appeal decision-makers be different than the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) that reached the initial determination; requiring appeal decision-makers to satisfy the robust anti-bias and training requirements of § 106.45(b)(1)(iii); giving both parties a meaningful and equal opportunity to submit written statements supporting or challenging the outcome; and requiring written determinations explaining the appeal result and rationales to be given to both parties. \nChanges: None. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00372 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230397 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \n1499Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, \n704 (1979). 1500We reiterate that as to complainants, revised \n§ 106.44(a) requires recipients to offer supportive \nmeasures to complainants, and the definition of supportive measures in § 106.30 states that supportive measures may be available for either party. Comments: Some commenters \nexpressed concern that § 106.45(b)(8) \nwas not drafted with the victim in mind. Commenters opposed restricting the complainant’s right to appeal because equal appeal rights are supported by experts, or because the complainant may have new evidence and restricting their appeal rights will put the integrity of the proceeding at risk.', 'Commenters asserted that complainants should have a say in the sanctions delivered to the respondents. Other commenters argued that complainants should be allowed to appeal sanctions because they will have a strong interest in doing so, while respondents should not be allowed to appeal sanctions because they would only do so out of self-interest. \nDiscussion: As discussed above, and \nin response to well-taken concerns raised by commenters, the Department has decided to remove the limitation contained in the NPRM that would have prevented complainants from appealing recipients’ sanction decisions. Under § 106.45(b)(8) of the final regulations, recipients have the discretion to permit parties to appeal sanctions. The Department wishes to clarify that if recipients decide to offer appeal rights regarding sanctions, then both complainants and respondents must have the same rights to appeal. We agree with commenters that it would be unfair and run counter to the spirit of Title IX to permit complainants to appeal sanction decisions but not permit respondents to appeal sanction decisions, and vice versa, and as such if a recipient allows appeals on the basis of severity of sanctions that appeal must be offered equally to both parties. \nChanges: None. \nComments: Some commenters argued \nthat the Department should require institutions to offer appeals. They argued that mandated appeals will ensure uniformity, reduce litigation, and will be necessary due to the decreased standard of liability. Other commenters expressed concern that offering complainants the right to appeal would violate due process. They argued that a false finding of responsibility will result in life-altering stigma and harm to respondents and that their interest in avoiding double jeopardy is significant. Some commenters suggested that if respondents are allowed to appeal, they should only be allowed to appeal for blatant errors. Some commenters argued that § 106.45(b)(8) was not clear that an appeals panel must be different from the original panel. Commenters suggested that the Department ensure a third-party appeals process to protect the fairness and independence of the decisions on appeal. Discussion: The Department is \npersuaded by the concerns raised by \ncommenters, and we note that § 106.45(b)(8) of the final regulations requires recipients to offer appeals equally to both parties. Further, we acknowledge that being found responsible for sexual misconduct under Title IX may carry a significant social stigma and life-altering consequences that could impact the respondent’s future educational and economic opportunities. However, we also believe that complainants have significant, life-altering interests at stake, and that they ‘‘have a right, and are entitled to expect, that they may attend [school] without fear of sexual assault or harassment.’’\n1501For these \nreasons, along with the centrality of appeals as a mechanism for addressing potential unfairness or error in an adjudication, the Department believes that appeal rights should be offered equally to both complainants and respondents in recipients’ Title IX proceedings. Further, we believe that appeal rights for respondents should not be limited to ‘‘blatant errors,’’ as suggested by one commenter. Instead, the final regulations specify the bases upon which either party can appeal, including procedural irregularity or bias or conflict of interest in key personnel involved in the adjudicative process that affected the outcome, or newly discovered evidence that would affect the outcome. Moreover, we recognize the importance of granting recipients flexibility and discretion in designing and implementing their Title IX systems; the Department believes recipients are in best position to know the unique needs and values of their educational communities. For this reason, § 106.45(b)(8) permits recipients to offer appeals to both parties on additional bases in their discretion. \nWith respect to ensuring that appeal \ndecision-makers are different \nindividuals than investigators, Title IX Coordinators, or decision-makers who rendered the initial determination regarding responsibility, the Department agrees with commenters and therefore, § 106.45(b)(8)(iii) makes it clear that the appeal decision-maker cannot be the same person as the decision-maker below, or as the Title IX Coordinator or investigator in the case. This ensures that the recipient’s appeal decision reviews the underlying case independently. The Department also notes that appeal decision-makers must be free from bias and conflicts of interest, and be trained to serve impartially, as required under \n§ 106.45(b)(1)(iii). \nWe respectfully disagree with the \ncommenters who argued that the final regulations should prohibit appeals of not responsible determinations because of double jeopardy concerns. As discussed above, we believe that both respondents and complainants face potentially life-altering consequences from the outcomes of Title IX proceedings. As such, it is important to protect complainants’ right to appeal as well as respondents’ right to appeal. \nThe Department does not believe that \na third party independent from the recipient would need to handle appeals \nto ensure impartiality and fairness.']"

Other commenters asserted that there may be a greater need for supportive measures in cases \ninvolving international students, women in career preparatory classes such as construction, manufacturing, and wielding, and lower-income students, for whom dropping out of school could have more drastic and long-lasting consequences. \nMany commenters requested that the \nDepartment reconsider or clarify the requirement in § 106.30 that the Title IX Coordinator is responsible for effective implementation of supportive measures, arguing that Title IX Coordinators cannot fulfill all the duties assigned to them under the proposed rules (especially if a recipient has only designated one individual as a Title IX Coordinator) and asserting that the responsibility to implement supportive measures could be easily delegated to \nother offices on campus. \nDiscussion: The Department \nappreciates commenters’ support for the § 106.30 definition of supportive measures, and we acknowledge commenters’ arguments that the language employed in the proposed definition of the term ‘‘supportive measures’’ is too respondent-focused or lessens the availability of measures to assist victims.

Commenters expressed concern the previous approach in guidance lacked \nprotections for the accused, and the proposed rules balance protection for the accused with \njustice for victims . Commenters asserted the proposed rules bring back the rule of law to thes e \nproceedings . Other commenters expressed concern that past Department guidance has led to \nviolations of students’ free speech rights. Another commenter asserted that by nature, \nuniversities are ill -equipped to handle criminal assault charges and asserted that if universities \nare going to deal with serious charges like sexual assault, it is critical that the sanctions they \nwield, which often can have significant consequences, are applied only after a fair process to \ndetermine facts and guilt; the commenter supported the process that the proposed regulations provide. \nCommenters expressed support for the Department’s general approach because it is \nflexible . Commenters supported the “not clearly unreasonable standard” in particular for this \nreason . Commenters also expressed support for this approach because it brings clarity to a very \nconfusing and complicated issue. Some commenters expressed support for the proposed rules because they are pro- women . Other commenters asserted that the proposed rule s add needed \nclarity to what is required by recipients under Title IX . Some commenters also stated that \nresponding to sexual harassment is a uniquely difficult challenge because, unlike sexual assault, it is intertwined with free speech. \nCommenters also expr essed support for the Department’s choice to respect survivors’ \nautonomy in deciding whether to initiate a grievance process in the higher education setting. Some commenters suggested expanding the deliberately indifferent standard to include the \nrespondent so that recipients must respond in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent toward a complainant or respondent.

Other commenters asked if the Department would \nconsider encouraging schools to inquire into anonymous and third- party reports as a means of \npreventing harassment from worsening.  Discussion : The Department appreciates the comments in support of the deliberate indifference \nstandard in § 106.44(a) . The deliberate indifference standard provides consistency with the Title \nIX rubric for judicial and administrative enforcement and gives a recipient sufficient flexibility \nand discretion to address sexual harassment . At the same time, for reasons explained in the \n“Adoption and Adaption of the Supreme Court’s Framework to Address Sexual Harassment” section of this preamble, the Department has tailored a deliberate indifference standard for \nadministrative enforcement purposes by adding specific obligations that every recipient must meet as part of every response to sexual harassment, including offering supportive measures to complainants through the Title IX Coordinator engaging in an interactive discussion with the complainant about the complainant’s wishes, and explaining to the complainant the option and process for filing a formal complaint. \nThe Department acknowledges that some commenters think that these final regulations \nare pro -women while others think that these final regulations are pro -men.

July 28, 2021), \nappeals pending\n (1st Cir.).The Department will\nno longer enforce this portion of the provision and any related statements in this document may not be relied upon.Several commenters opposed § 106.45 by noting that F ederal court s have not required the \nparticular procedures required under § 106.45, and challenging the Department’s rationale for \nprescribing a grievance process that provides more procedural protections than the Supreme Court has required under constitutional due pro cess. Some commenters argued that the \nDepartment’s authority under Title IX permits the Department to regulate recipients’ grievance procedures only to ensure that the formal complaint process does not discriminate against any party based on sex.  \nSeveral commenters requested that the Department reserve the “stringent” grievance \nprocess required under § 106.45 only for complaints that allege sexual assault, involve allegations of violence, or otherwise subject a respondent to a potential sanction of expulsi on. \nA few commenters asserted that to the extent that bias and lack of impartiality in school-\nlevel Title IX proceedings have resulted in sex discrimination sometimes against women and other times against men, the provisions in § 106.45 prohibiting bias, c onflicts of interest, and sex \nstereotypes used in training materials, and requiring objective evaluation of all relevant evidence and equal opportunity for the parties to present, review, and challenge testimony and other evidence, will reduce the likelihood that sex discrimination will occur in Title IX proceedings because even if school officials harbor intentional or unintentional sex -based biases or \nprejudices, such improper biases and prejudices are less likely to affect the handling of the matter when  the process requires application of procedures grounded in principles of due process. \nSome commenters objected to the use of the words “due process” and “due process \nprotections” in § 106.45, believing that using the term “due process” blurs the line betw een \nconstitutional due process owed by recipients that are S tate actors, and a “fair process” that all \nrecipients, including private institutions, generally owe by contract with students and employees. \n275  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n  \n \n  \n    \n    \n \n \n  \n     \n    \n  \n   \n   \n \n \n \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

These commenters suggested that the phrase “fair process” replace “due process” in § 106.45. Discussion : The § 106.45 grievance process prescribed by the final regulation s directly serve s \nthe purposes of Tit le IX by providing a framework under which recipients reliably determine the \nfacts of sexual harassment allegations in order to provide appropriate remedies for victims of sexual harassment  when the recipient has determined the respondent is responsible. T he \nDepartment recognizes that some recipients are S tate actors with responsibilities to provide due \nprocess of law  to students and employees under the U.S. Constitution , while other recipients are \nprivate institutions that do not have constitutional obligations to their students and employees. The Department believes that conforming to the § 106.45 grievance process likely will meet \nconstitutional due process obligations in Title IX sexual harassment proceedings, and as the \nDepartment has recognized in guidance for nearly 20 years, Title IX rights must be interpreted \nconsistent with due process guarantees.\n470 However, independent of constitutional due process, \nthe purpose of the § 106.45 grievance process is to provide individuals with effective protection from discriminatory practices, including remedies for sexual harassment victims, by consistent application of procedures that improve perceptions that Title IX sexual harassment allegations \nare resolved fairly, avoid injection of sex -based biases and stereotypes into Title IX proceedings, \nand promote reliable outcomes. \n470 2001 Guidance at 22.', 'v.

The Department’s view is that there is no inherent conflict between Title VII and Title IX, including these final regulations. For example, Title VII defines sexual harassment as severe or pervasive conduct, \nwhile Title IX defines sexual harassment as severe and pervasive conduct . Nothing in these final \nregulations precludes a recipient -employer from addressing conduct that it i s severe or pervasive, \nand § 106.45(b)(3)(i) provides that a mandatory dismissal under these final regulations does not preclude action under another provision of the recipient’s code of conduct. Thus, a recipient-employer may address conduct that is sever e or pervasive under a code of conduct for employees \nto satisfy its Title VII obligations. Courts impose different requirements under Title VII and Title IX, and recipients comply with case law that interprets Title VII and Title IX differently . \nSimilarly, recipients may comply with different regulations implementing Title VII and Title IX . \nFor example, nothing in Title VII precludes an employer from allowing employees to file formal \ncomplaints or from providing notice to an employee such as notice of the a llegations against the \nemployee or notice of the dismissal of any allegations as required in these final regulations. \nThese final regulations require all recipients with actual knowledge of sexual harassment in an \neducation program or activity of the recipient  against a person in the United States , to respond \npromptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent, irrespective of whether the complainant and respondent are students or employees. \nThe Department is not exercising direction, supervisio n, or control over any recipient’s \nadministration or personnel. Indeed, § 106.44(b)( 2) specifically states that the Assistant \nSecretary will not deem a recipient’s determination regarding responsibility to be evidence of deliberate indifference by the recipient, or otherwise evidence of discrimination under Title IX \n1524  \n   \n \n   \n    \n   \n   \n    \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Accordingly, the Department will not dictate what the recipient’s determination regarding responsibility should be for a respondent who is an employee. Similarly, the Department will not require a recipient to impose a specific type of disciplinary sanction on a respondent who is an employee. The Department \nonly requires a recipient to describe the range of possible disciplinary sanctions in § \n106.45(b)(1)(vi) and does not otherwise require a recipient to include specific disciplinary \nsanctions. \nThe Department acknowledges that the grievance proce ss in § 106.45 may apply to \nemployees and disagrees that applying such a grievance process to employees is an expansion of Title VII. The grievance process in § 106.45 does not contradict Title VII or its implementing regulations in any manner and at most may provide more process than Title VII requires . These \nfinal regulations, however, do not expand Title VII, as these final regulations are promulgated \nunder Title IX. As previously explained, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in a \nrecipient’s education program or activity against a person in the United States. Title IX and these \nimplementing regulations do not necessarily apply in all circumstances, and there may be circumstances in which Title VII but not Title IX applies . For example, if the alleged sexual \nharassment did not occur in an education program or activity of the recipient, then Title IX and these final regulations would not apply. Changes : None.']"

Commenters identified an array of harms they believed the proposed rules would impose on victims. Commenters argued the proposed rules would: Make it less likely victims will be protected, believed, or supported; make it harder for survivors to report their sexual assaults, to get their cases heard, to prove their claims, and to receive justice, despite a process that is already difficult, painful, convoluted, confusing, and lacking in resources, and in which victims fear coming forward; attack survivors in ways that make it harder for them to get help; restrict their rights and harm them academically and psychologically (e.g., dropping out of \nschool, trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, institutional betrayal, suicide). Commenters argued that the proposed rules would: discourage survivors from coming forward and subject them to retraumatizing experiences in order to seek redress; make schools dangerous by making it easier for perpetrators to get away with heinous acts of gender-based violence; encourage sexually predatory behavior; fail to prioritize the safety of survivors and students; make students feel less safe at school and on campus; jeopardize students’ well-being; increase the helplessness survivors feel; and leave victims without recourse. Commenters argued that the proposed rules: Put victims at greater risk of retaliation by schools eager to hide misconduct from the public; treat some people as less than others based on gender; signal that survivors do not matter and that sexual assault can be ignored; hurt real women or show disdain for women and girls; and deny victims due process. Commenters believed that the proposed rules were antithetical to bodily autonomy and reproductive justice values, fail to \nadvance the goal of stopping sexual violence, and shift the costs and burdens to those already suffering from trauma. \nDiscussion: The Department disagrees \nthat the proposed regulations will negatively impact women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, or any other population. The proposed regulations are designed to provide supportive measures for all complainants and remedies for a complainant when a respondent is found responsible for sexual harassment, and the Department believes that, contrary to commenters’ assertions, the final regulations will help protect against sex discrimination regardless of a person’s race or ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, or gender identity and will give complainants greater autonomy to receive the kind of school-level response to a reported incident of sexual harassment that will best help the complainant overcome the effects of sexual harassment and retain educational access. The Department notes that the final regulations do not differentiate between sexual assault occurring at an all-women’s college and sexual assault occurring at a college enrolling women and men. \nThe Department believes that \nstudents, employees, recipients, and the public will benefit from the clarity, consistency, and predictability of legally enforceable rules for responding to sexual harassment set forth in the final regulations, and believes that the final regulations will communicate and incentivize these goals, contrary to some commenters’ assertions that the final regulations will communicate negative messages to the public. The final regulations, including the § 106.45 grievance process, are motivated by fair treatment of both parties in order to avoid sex discrimination in the way either party is treated and to reach reliable determinations so that victims receive remedies that restore or preserve access to education after suffering sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment. The Department recognizes that anyone can be a victim, and anyone can be a perpetrator, of sexual harassment, and that each individual deserves a fair process designed to \naccurately resolve the truth of allegations.', 'Some commenters expressed \nopposition because the proposed rules protect institutions. Some of these commenters contended that the proposed rules would allow schools to avoid dealing with cases of sexual misconduct and abdicate their responsibility to take accusations seriously. One of these commenters argued it was the Department’s job to protect the civil rights of students, not to help shield schools from accountability. One commenter argued that the proposed regulations had been pushed for by education lobbyists. Some \ncommenters expressed concerns about reducing schools’ Title IX obligations noting that schools have a long history of not adequately addressing sexual misconduct, have reputational, financial, and other incentives not to fully confront such behavior, and need to be kept accountable under Title IX. A few commenters felt that the proposed regulations would give school officials too much discretion and that the proposed regulations would result in inconsistencies among institutions in handling cases and in the support provided to students. \nA number of commenters felt that the \nproposed rules prioritize the interests of schools, by narrowing their liability and saving them money, over protections for students. One commenter stated that universities that discriminate on the basis of sex should get no Federal money. One commenter was concerned that the proposed rules would create an environment in which institutions will refuse to take responsibility to avoid the financial aspect of having to make restitution rather than focusing on the well-being of victims. One commenter contended that the proposed rules enable school administrators to sexually abuse students by reducing a school’s current Title IX responsibilities. One commenter stated that the proposed rules would hurt victims and perpetrators and leave institutions vulnerable to lawsuits. \nOther commenters expressed a belief \nthat the changes may violate constitutional safeguards, such as the rights to equal protection and to life and liberty. Some commenters believed that the proposed rules are in line with regressive laws regarding rape, sexual assault, and women’s rights in less democratic countries. A few commenters felt that the proposed rules would signal an increased tolerance internationally for sexual violence, cause international students to avoid U.S. colleges where sexual assault is more prevalent, or compromise the country’s ability to compete internationally in STEM fields where U.S. women are reluctant to focus given the prevalence of sexual harassment. \nDiscussion: The final regulations \nreflect the Department’s legal and policy decisions of how to best effectuate the \nnon-discrimination mandate of Title IX, after extensive internal deliberation, stakeholder engagement, and public comment. The Department is aware of statistics that describe the prevalence of sexual harassment in educational environments and appreciates the many commenters who directed the Department’s attention to such statistics.\n293The Department believes \nthat these final regulations are needed precisely because statistics support the numerous personal accounts the Department has heard and that commenters have described regarding the problem of sexual harassment. The perspectives of survivors of sexual violence have been prominent in the public comments considered by the Department throughout the process of promulgating these final regulations. In response to commenters concerned about addressing domestic violence, the Department has revised the definition of ‘‘sexual harassment’’ in § 106.30 to expressly include domestic violence (and dating violence, and stalking) as those offenses are defined under VAWA, amending the Clery Act. \nThe Department does not believe the \nfinal regulations will reduce reporting or investigations of conduct that falls under the purview of Title IX. Section 106.44(a) requires recipients to respond supportively to complainants regardless of whether a complainant also wants to file a formal complaint. When a formal complaint is filed, the § 106.45 grievance process prescribes a consistent framework, fair to both complainants and respondents, with respect to the investigation and adjudication of Title IX sexual harassment allegations. Thus, both complainants and respondents receive due process protections, and where a § 106.45 grievance process concludes with a determination that a respondent is responsible, the complainant is entitled to remedies. Whether false accusations of sexual harassment occur frequently or infrequently, the § 106.45 grievance process requires allegations to be investigated and adjudicated impartially, without bias, based on objective evaluation of the evidence relevant to each situation. \nAs to all sexual harassment covered \nby Title IX, including sexual assault, the final regulations obligate recipients to respond and prescribe a consistent, predictable grievance process for resolution of formal complaints. Nothing in the final regulations precludes a recipient from applying the § 106.45 grievance process to address sexual assaults that the recipient is not required to address under Title IX. The Department disagrees that the proposed regulations put undue financial burden on marginalized individuals to pay for representation.', 'Several commenters contended that women are more likely to be sexually assaulted than a man is to be falsely accused and similarly, a man is more likely to be sexually assaulted than to be \nfalsely accused of sexual assault . \nOne commenter stated that the proposed rules would create a two -tiered system to deal \nwith sexual assault cases and w ould put undue financial burden on the marginalized to pay for \nrepresentation in an already flaw ed reporting system . One commenter stated that Title IX should \nprotect all female students from rape, and they should be believed until facts prove them wrong.  \nSome commenters expressed opposition because the proposed rules protect institutions. \nSome of these commenters contended that the proposed rules would allow schools to avoid dealing with cases of sexual misconduct and abdicate their responsibility to take accusations seriously .

Recommendations for Agency Action.’’ under Title IX or violations of the \nDepartment’s Title IX regulations, consistent with 20 U.S.C. 1682. \nChanges: We have revised § 106.3(a) \nto clarify that the Department may require a recipient to take remedial action for discriminating in violation of Title IX or for violating Title IX implementing regulations. We have removed the reference to assessment of damages and instead state that remedial action must be consistent with the Title IX statute at 20 U.S.C. 1682. \nComments: Commenters stated that \nbecause the current regulations need clarity and modification, it is good that the proposed rules addressed the remedies issue. Some commenters stated that the proposed rules set forth a fair and reliable procedure with respect to damages and remedies. Commenters who worked for postsecondary institutions expressed support for proposed § 106.3(a) as a significant improvement upon the current Title IX landscape. Some commenters on behalf of institutions expressed appreciation for the focus on remedial action that does not include the assessment of damages against a recipient because some recipients are small, rural schools with limited resources, and would prefer to use those resources to remedy violations rather than pay damages. Commenters asserted that proposed § 106.3(a) helps recipient institutions avoid unnecessary burdens. Commenters stated that they supported the limitation of remedial action to exclude assessment of damages against the recipient because parties seeking monetary damages may always avail themselves of the courts, which are better equipped than OCR to assess damages to compensate a victim for harms like emotional distress. One commenter asserted that proposed § 106.3(a) would appropriately focus Title IX enforcement on securing equitable relief and bringing schools into compliance with Title IX. Commenters offered that it is appropriate for OCR to focus exclusively on equitable relief and bringing schools into compliance, as opposed to compensating victims. \nDiscussion: The Department \nappreciates some commenters’ support for the intention of proposed § 106.3(a), to distinguish between monetary \ndamages and equitable relief in determining remedial action the Department should pursue in its administrative enforcement actions. However, for the reasons discussed above, the Department is persuaded by the concerns of other commenters and we have revised § 106.3(a) to remove reference to assessment of damages. Changes: We have revised § 106.3(a) \nto clarify that the Department may require a recipient to take remedial action for discriminating in violation of Title IX or for violating Title IX implementing regulations. We have removed the reference to assessment of damages and instead state that remedial action must be consistent with the Title IX statute at 20 U.S.C. 1682. \nComments: Some commenters argued \nthat proposed § 106.3(a) conveyed that the Department will not be enforcing Title IX at all and will look the other way at a recipient’s failure to respond to allegations of sexual harassment. Another commenter suggested that the proposed rules ought to state that all remedial action should be dedicated to minimizing, to the extent possible, harm done to the complainant. One commenter argued that proposed § 106.3 would create an inconsistency with other laws and regulations that OCR enforces, such as Title VI or Section 504. \nOne commenter argued that § 106.3(a) \nis a change in position from prior Department guidance that contemplates monetary relief, is in tension with a Department of Justice manual about Title IX,\n1541and could potentially put \nthe Department’s Title IX enforcement practices in tension with other executive branch agencies that enforce Title IX. The commenter asserted that it is strange for a complainant’s scope of relief to change depending on the agency with which the complaint is filed. The commenter asserted that such a significant shift ought to be more fulsomely explained by the Department. Additionally, the commenter stated that the commenter had filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request but had not yet received a response, and that the proposed rules ought to be withdrawn until the commenter had opportunity to review the FOIA response and comment further.', 'Changes : We have revised § 106.3(a) to clarify that the Department may require a recipient to \ntake remed ial action for discriminati ng in violation of Title IX or for violating Title IX \nimplementing regulations.

Commenters argued that \n§ 106.6(d) is necessary in light of the growing number of instances in which institutions have \nviolated students’ rights in campus Title IX adjudications . Commenters expressed support for the \nsaving clause nature of this provision because of concerns that Title IX has a disproportionate impact on men of color and other disadvantaged demographic groups. \nSome commenters requested more clarity on the application of the saving clause to \nspecific situations . Commenters requested that OCR “provide additional guidance or clarity on \nwhat responsibilities school districts have with respect to the First Amendment and other \nconstitutional protections. ” One commenter requested guidance on the parameters of free speech \nprotections. Other commenters supported the saving clause but requested that the Department \nmodify the language to provide greater protection for free speech, such as providing explicit \nprotection of academic freedom, or such as changing the provision to not just state that the regulations do not require a recipient to restrict constitutional rights, but that the regulations do not permit deprivations of constitutional rights. Some commenters expressed confusion as to whether the saving clauses in 106.6(d) cover recipients that are not government actors. \nA number of commenters opposed the saving clause because they believed it is \nunnecessa ry.  \nOne commenter opposed the saving clause due to the concern that it could be seen as \ncalling for the courts to give greater weight to the listed constitutional protections than a court \nmay have given otherwise.

Commenters noted that \nsome State laws, for example Maryland and New York, address the same issue with rules prohibiting “prior” sexual history. Discussion : The Department agrees with commenters that the rape shield protections serve a \ncritically important purpose in a Title IX sexual harassment grievance process: protecting complainants from being asked about or having evidence considered regarding sexual behavior, with two limited exceptions.

Scenarios described \nby commenters, where a respondent might wish to prove the complainant had a motive to \nfabricate or conceal a sexual interaction, do not require admission or consideration of the complainant’s sexual behavior. Respondents in that scenario could pr obe a complainant’s motive \nby, for example, inquiring whether a complainant had a dating or romantic relationship with a person other than the respondent, without delving into a complainant’s sexual behavior; sexual behavior evidence would remain irrelevant in such circumstances. Commenters correctly note that the Department adapted the rape shield language in § 106.45(b)(6)(i) from Fed. R. Evid. 412.\n1349 As with other determinations about what procedures should be part of a § 106.45 \ngrievance process, the Department carefully considered whether Fed. R. Evid. 412 would be useful in formulating rape shield provisions for application in Title IX adjudications. However , \nthe final regulations do not import wholesale Fed. R. Evid. 412. The Department believes the protections of the rape shield language remain stronger if decision- makers are not given \ndiscretion to decide that sexual behavior is admissible where its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to a victim and unfair prejudice to any par ty. If the Department \npermitted decision -makers to balance ambiguous factors like “unfair prejudice” to make \nadmissibility decisions, the final regulations would convey an expectation that a non- lawyer \ndecision- maker must possess the legal expertise of judges and lawyers. Instead, the Department \nexpects decision -makers to apply a single admissibility rule (relevance) , including this \n1349 83 FR 61476 (regarding § 106.45(b)(6)(i)- (ii), the NPRM stated “These sections inc orporate language from (and \nare in the spirit of) the rape shield protections found in Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which is intended to safeguard \ncomplainants against invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment, and stereotyping.

As noted by the Supreme Court, rape shiel d protections generally are designed to protect complainants from harassing, irrelevant \ninquiries into sexual behavior at trial .\n1353 The final regulations permit exchange of all evidence \n“directly related to the allegations in a formal complaint” during the investigation, but require the investigator to only summarize “relevant” evidence in the investigative report (which would exclude sexual history information deemed by these final regulations to be “ not relevant”), and \nrequire the decision -maker to objectively evaluate only “relevant” evidence during the hearing \nand when reaching the determination regarding responsibility. To furthe r reinforce the \nimportance of correct application of the rape shield protections, we have revised § 106.45(b)(6)(i) to explicitly state that only relevant questions may be asked, and the decision-maker must determine the relevance of each cross-examination question before a party or witness must answer. \nCommenters correctly observe that the final regulations do not define “consent.” For \nreasons explained in the “Consent” subsection of the “ Section  106.30 Definitions” section of this \npreamble, the final regulations clarify that the Department will not require recipients to adopt a \n1353 Michigan v.

This provision in § 106.30 allows recipients flexibility to use a \ndefinition of sexual consent that best reflects the recipient’s values and/or co mplies with State \nlaws that require recipients to adopt particular definitions of consent for campus sexual misconduct proceedings . The second of the two exceptions to the rape shield protections refers to \n“if offered to prove consent” and thus the scope of that exception will turn in part on the definition of consent adopted by each recipient. Decision-makers will be trained in how to conduct a grievance process and specifically on how to apply the rape shield protections, which will include the recipient’s adopted definition of consent, and thus the decision- maker will \nunderstand how to apply the rape shield language in accordance with that definition. Because of the flexibility recipients have under these final regulations to adopt a definition of consent , the \nDepartment disagrees that the scope of the second exception to the rape shield protections is too broad or favors respondents. Rather, the scope of the “offered to prove consent” exception is determined in part by a recipient’s definition of consent, which may be broad or narrow at the \nrecipient’s discretion. The Department disagrees that the first exception (“offered to prove that \nsomeone other than the respondent” committed the alleged misconduct) is too broad, because in order for that exception to  apply a respondent’s contention must be that someone other than the \nrespondent is the person who committed the sexual harassment; commenters have informed the Department that this defense is not common compared to the defense that a sexual interaction occurred but consent was present, a conclusion buttressed by commenters’ assertions that a \nsignificant number of sexual assaults are committed by intimate partners.', 'The Department reiterates that the rape shield language in this provision does not pertain to the sexual predisposition or sexual behavior of respondents, so evidence of a pattern of inappropriate behavior by an alleged harasser must be judged for relevance as any other evidence must be. \nAs discussed above, the Department \ndefers to recipients on a definition of consent, and thus recipients subject to State laws imposing particular definitions may comply with those State laws during a § 106.45 grievance process. The recipient’s definition of consent will determine the scope of the rape shield exception that refers to ‘‘consent.’’ The Department does not believe that the provision needs to expressly state that a complainant’s sexual behavior can never be allowed to prove a complainant’s reputation or character; rather, this provision already deems irrelevant all questions or evidence of a complainant’s prior sexual behavior unless offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the alleged offense or if the questions or evidence concern specific sexual behavior between the complainant and respondent and are offered to prove consent. No other use of a complainant’s sexual behavior is authorized under this provision. \nThe Department declines to require \nquestions or evidence that may meet one of the rape shield exceptions to be allowed to be asked or presented at a hearing only if a neutral evaluator first decides that one of the two exceptions applies. As discussed above, the decision-maker will be trained in how to conduct a grievance process, including how to determine relevance and how to apply the rape shield protections, and at the live hearing the decision-maker must determine the relevance of a cross-examination question before a party or witness must answer. As discussed above, the Department declines to import a balancing test that would exclude sexual behavior questions and evidence (even meeting the two exceptions) unless probative value substantially outweighs potential harm or undue prejudice, because that open-ended, complicated standard of admissibility would render the adjudication more difficult for a layperson decision-maker competently to apply. Unlike the two exceptions in this provision, a balancing test of probative value, harm, and prejudice contains no concrete factors for a decision-maker to look to in making the relevance determination. \nThe Department’s use of the phrase \n‘‘sexual predisposition’’ is mirrored in Fed. R. Evid. 412; far from indicating intent to harken back to the past where sexual practices of a complainant were used against a complainant, the final regulations take a strong position that questions or evidence of a complainant’s ‘‘sexual predisposition’’ are simply irrelevant, without exception. \nThe final regulations clarify the rape \nshield language to state that questions and evidence subject to the rape shield protections are ‘‘not relevant,’’ and therefore the rape shield protections apply wherever the issue is whether \nevidence is relevant or not. As noted above, this means that where § 106.45(b)(5)(vi) requires review and inspection of evidence ‘‘directly related to the allegations’’ that universe of evidence is not screened for relevance, but rather is measured by whether it is ‘‘directly related to the allegations.’’ However, the investigative report must \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00329 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230354 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \n1355The Department notes that ‘‘prior’’ sexual \nbehavior is a phrase widely used by commenters to \ndiscuss rape shield protections, and commenters noted that various State laws, such as New York and Maryland, use the word ‘‘prior’’ to distinguish a complainant’s sexual behavior that is unrelated to the sexual misconduct allegations at issue. The Department emphasizes that ‘‘prior’’ does not imply admissibility of questions or evidence about a complainant’s sexual behavior that occurred after \nthe alleged sexual harassment incident, but rather must mean anything ‘‘prior’’ to conclusion of the grievance process. This aligns with the intent of Fed. R. Evid. 412, which prohibits evidence of a victim’s ‘‘other’’ sexual behavior; the Advisory Committee Notes on that rule explain that use of the word ‘‘other’’ is to ‘‘suggest some flexibility in admitting evidence ‘intrinsic’ to the alleged sexual misconduct.’’ The Department chooses to use the \nphrase ‘‘prior sexual behavior’’ rather than ‘‘other sexual behavior’’ because based on public comments, ‘‘prior sexual behavior’’ is a widely understood reference to evidence unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment at issue.']"

Many commenters found the three- \nyear retention period confusing and \nargued that the Department provided no rationale for it. Commenters stated the retention period would conflict with State requirements, or other disciplinary actions (e.g., long-term suspension) that \nrequire longer document retention (e.g., in Washington State, districts must retain records related to discrimination complaints for six years.) \nSeveral commenters, in asserting that \nthe three-year retention period is too short, proposed alternate retention periods. One commenter stated, in order to avoid conflict with State requirements, the Department should modify § 106.45(b)(10) to read: ‘‘maintain for a minimum of three years or as required by State statute . . .’’ or ‘‘seven years, or 3 years after all parties graduate, whichever is sooner,’’ or keeping records until one year after a student graduates. Some commenters stated the retention period should not be tied to the Clery Act’s limitation period for reporting specific campus crimes in an annual security report. (Clery Act, 20 U.S.C. 1092(f); 34 CFR 668.46(c)(1) (requiring schools to annually report all crimes which occurred in the prior three calendar years by the end of the following year). Other commenters suggested the period be six years, or modified to state ‘‘files should be retained for the time the student is involved on campus and extended for a reasonable time period that considers the student may enroll for a graduate degree.’’ \nMany commenters proposed that \nrecords be kept for a minimum of seven years, instead of three, in keeping with best practices for student record-keeping as well as general accounting practices. Some commenters stated medical and tax records are required to be kept for seven years, so records of sexual abuse should be kept for the same amount of time, if not more. Furthermore, the commenters stated a three-year period would hinder the Department’s efforts to ensure compliance, especially if a continuing violation is alleged or class- wide discrimination is occurring over multiple years, and conflict with the Clery records retention requirement of seven years. Rather, commenters asserted, this section should mirror the Clery Act retention effective time period requirement of seven years to avoid confusion and the potential for documents to be misfiled and destroyed. Commenters recommended this provision be modified to state: ‘‘All records must be kept for at least three years following the generation of the last \nrecord associated with the report or complaint.’’ Or: ‘‘. . . and maintain for \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00384 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230409 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \na period of three years from the date the \ndisciplinary proceedings, including any appeals, is completed.’’ Commenters also requested to extend the time period by stating: ‘‘. . . or in the presence of an active investigation by OCR or other court system, until the investigation and determination is completed.’’ Commenters noted that in the past, OCR complaints involving campus sexual assault have taken an average of more than four years to resolve. \nMany commenters recommended that \nthe retention period be linked to the parties’ attendance in the recipient’s program or activity. For example, commenters referenced the FERPA statute in recommending that the standard time period for retention be five to seven years after graduation or separation from an institution. Other commenters recommended the retention period be changed to three years or the point at which any parties are no longer in attendance at the institution, whichever comes later. Commenters stated that three-year retention period should be limited to student- complainants or student-respondents because if one or both parties are staff or faculty, their association with the recipient may extend for many years. Commenters recommended that § 106.45(b)(10) require the recipient to create, gather, and maintain the records for the duration of the students’ time in school and then five years after the last student involved has graduated, and to define all important terms in a way that prevents loopholes and misconduct.', 'Many commenters recommended that the retention period be linked to the parties’ \nattendance in the recipient’s program or activity .

Commenters requested that \nthis requirement be made permissive for elementary and secondary school recipients – that such \nrecipients “may” create records – and may only retain them for one year, stating that some \nprimary or secondary schools are not required to maintain these kinds of records, and may not retain them in excess of one year . \nSome commenters recommended that records be maintained for a minimum of ten  years, \narguing that, if not, the proposed rule s would decrease the volume of relevant records, and in \nturn burden the Federal government because Federal background clearance investigations would become unreliable; agencies would inevitably make a favorable national security clearance or employment suitability determination without being aware of a candidate’s past proven sexual assault if it occurred more than three  years prior. \nSome commenters stated that records should be kept based on the criminal justice \nsystems’ statutes of limitations, if not longer, to ensure consistency between institutional \nstandards and State standards and ensuring parties can appropriately represent themselves. The three -year requirement could undermine criminal prosecutions related to the incidents at issue \nbecause it would permit r ecipients to discard vital records that could help the criminal \nprosecution of sexual assault or rape before the statute of limitations for such crimes has run, thereby potentially letting the perpetrators go free . For example, commenters contended, an \nelementary and secondary school could have ceased maintaining records of a sexual assault \ninvestigation before the student reaches the age of 18 and has the ability to vindicate their own rights.

Other commenters suggested the period be \nsix years, or modified to state “files should be retained for the time the student is involved on \ncampus and extended for a reasonable time period that considers the student may enroll for a graduate degree.” \nMany commenters proposed that records be kept for a minimum of seven years, instead \nof three, in keeping with best practices for student record-keeping as well as general accounting practices. Some commenters stated medical and tax records are required  to be kept for seven \nyears, so records of sexual abuse should be kept for the same amount of time, if not more.

The Department has also added § 106.71(b)(2) to provide that charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith does not constitute retaliation, provided that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a such a false statement. \nFalse Allegations \nComments: A number of commenters \nreferred the Department to statistics, \ndata, research, and studies relating to the frequency of false accusations of sexual misconduct. Most commenters who raised the issue of false allegations cited data for the proposition that somewhere between two to ten percent of sexual assault reports are false or unfounded.\n424Commenters asserted \nthat despite the low frequency of false allegations, police officers tend to believe false allegations of rape are much more common than they actually \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:08 May 18, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\19MYR2.SGM 19MYR230085 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Rules and Regulations \n425Commenters cited: David Lisak et al., False \nAllegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten \nYears of Reported Cases, 16 Violence Against Women 12 (2010). \n426Commenters cited, e.g., Cassia Spohn & \nKatharine Tellis, Policing and Prosecuting Sexual Assault in Los Angeles City and County: A Collaborative Study in Partnership with the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office (2012) (‘‘Complainants’ motivations for filing false reports, which fell into five overlapping categories, included a desire to avoid trouble or a need for an alibi for consensual sex with someone other than a current partner, a desire to retaliate against a current or former partner, a need for attention or sympathy, and guilt or remorse as a result of consensual sexual activity. Many complainants in the unfounded cases also had mental health issues that made it difficult for them to separate fact from fantasy.’’).']"

The commenter argued that opponents of the proposed rules are better funded, and that there is less of a stigma to openly criticizing the Department than there is in saying that one was accused of sexual harassment, even if wrongly accused, and openly supporting the Department’s proposed rules. Another commenter argued that depriving respondents of relevant evidence only created more victims, not fewer. \nDiscussion: The Department \nappreciates the commenters’ perspectives. \nChanges: None. \nComments: Several commenters \nopposed the requirement in § 106.45(b)(5)(v) (written notice of investigative interviews, meetings, and hearings) because they stated it \ngenerally conflicts with FERPA. One commenter suggested adding a FERPA compliance clause to § 106.45(b)(5)(v) due to concerns about student privacy. \nOne commenter argued specifically \nthat the requirement in § 106.45(b)(5)(v) that recipients disclose the identities of all the parties’ conflicts with FERPA. One commenter specifically argued that requiring a recipient to disclose all sanctions imposed on the respondent conflicts with the school’s responsibilities under FERPA. Several commenters specifically suggested that the Department remove from the documentation of the recipient’s response to a Title IX complaint any requirement to include information regarding remedies and supportive measures accessed by a complainant who is a student. \nSeveral commenters stated that the \nparties should not be informed of the remedies given to the complainant, or to the disciplinary sanctions imposed on the respondent, in cases where the allegation involves assault, stalking, dating violence, or other violent crimes. Not only does disclosure of these items violate FERPA, but it would be troubling, for instance, to inform a respondent that after they were found responsible, the complainant was given \nremedies like moving to other classes, counseling, and so on. Commenters also asserted that the respondent who is found responsible should not have any knowledge about what safety measures the school is taking to protect the complainant, since those very measures will be undermined if the respondent learns of them.', 'The \nDepartment is bound by the U.S. Constitution and must interpret Title IX and FERPA in a \nmanner that does not violate a person’s due process rights, including notice and an opportunity to \nrespond. If a complainant or respondent provides sensitive records such as medical records as part of an investigation, then the parties must have an equal opportunity to inspect and review information that constitutes evidence directly related to the allegations raised in a formal \ncomplaint. If some of the information in the medical records is not directly related to the \nallegations raised in a formal complaint, then these final regulations do not require a recipient to \nshare the information that is not directly related to the allegations raised in the formal complaint. \nAs previously explained, the Department has clarified in § 106.45(b)(5)(i) that a recipient cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a party’s records that are made or maintained by a \nphysician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting \nin the professional’s or paraprofessional’s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and mainta ined in connection with provision of treatment to the party, unless the recipient \nobtains that party’s voluntary, written consent to do so for the grievance process under § \n106.45(b).

Some noted that there is no express carve-out under FERPA for such proceedings, and that schools will quickly be caught trying to navigate the legal boundaries of their obligations.']"

(i) For postsecondary \ninstitutions, the recipient’s grievance process must provide for a live hearing. At the live hearing, the decision- maker(s) must permit each party’s advisor to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Such cross- examination at the live hearing must be conducted directly, orally, and in real time by the party’s advisor of choice and never by a party personally, notwithstanding the discretion of the recipient under paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section to otherwise restrict the extent to which advisors may participate in the proceedings. At the request of either party, the recipient must provide for the live hearing to occur with the parties located in separate rooms with technology enabling the decision-maker(s) and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. Only relevant cross- examination and other questions may be asked of a party or witness. Before a complainant, respondent, or witness answers a cross-examination or other question, the decision-maker(s) must first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant. If a party does not have an advisor present at the live hearing, the recipient must provide without fee or charge to that party, an advisor of the recipient’s choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney, to conduct cross- examination on behalf of that party. Questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent. If a party or witness does not submit to cross- examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility; provided, however, that \nthe decision-maker(s) cannot draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party’s or witness’s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross- examination or other questions. Live hearings pursuant to this paragraph may be conducted with all parties physically present in the same geographic location or, at the recipient’s discretion, any or all parties, witnesses, and other participants may appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology enabling participants simultaneously to see and hear each other. Recipients must create an audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of any live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review. \n(ii) For recipients that are elementary \nand secondary schools, and other recipients that are not postsecondary institutions, the recipient’s grievance process may, but need not, provide for a hearing. With or without a hearing, \nafter the recipient has sent the investigative report to the parties pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(vii) of this section and before reaching a determination regarding responsibility, the decision-maker(s) must afford each party the opportunity to submit written, relevant questions that a party wants asked of any party or witness, provide each party with the answers, and allow for additional, limited follow-up questions from each party. With or without a hearing, questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent. The decision-maker(s) must explain to the party proposing the questions any decision to exclude a question as not relevant. \n(7) Determination regarding \nresponsibility. (i) The decision-maker(s), \nwho cannot be the same person(s) as the Title IX Coordinator or the investigator(s), must issue a written determination regarding responsibility. To reach this determination, the recipient must apply the standard of evidence described in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section.', 'Changes : The Department has revised § 106.45(b)(6)(i) to add language authorizing recipients to \nconduct live hearings virtually, specifically providing that live hearings pursuant to this subsection may be conducted with all parties physically present in the same geographic location, or at the recipient’s discretion, any or all parties, witnesses, and other participants may appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology enabling participants simultaneously to see and hear \n1228  \n  \n   \n \n   \n  \n   \n   \n \n  \n \n    \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n     \n \n  \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

However, the \nDepartment does not believe such a presumption would operate to protect complainants in any manner not already provided for in the final regulations. Section 106.44(a) already requires the recipient essentially to treat a \ncomplainant as a victim in need of services in the aftermath of suffering sexual harassment (by offering supportive \nmeasures and engaging in an interactive discussion with the complainant to arrive at helpful supportive measures to \npreserve the complainant’s equal educational access) even before, or without, a fact -finding process that has \ndetermined that the respondent victimized the complainant. Moreover, the grievance process effectively requires a complaina nt to be treated as a victim in two specific provisions that apply for complainants’ benefit: § \n106.45(b)(6)(i)- (ii) provides rape shield protection for complainants – but not respondents – against questions and \nevidence inquiring into the complainant’s prior sexual behavior; and § 106.45(b)(6)(i) allows either party to request that a live hearing (including cross -examination) occurs in separate rooms. While the latter provision applies on its \nface to both parties, the provision is responsive to public comment informing the Department that complainants already traumatized by sexual violence likely will be traumatized by coming face -to-face with the respondent; no \nsuch concerns about the traumatic effect of personal confrontation were raised on behalf of respondents. Thus, \nwhere appropriate, the grievance process takes into account the unique needs of complainants, in ways that the \nDepartment believes serve Title IX’s non -discrimination mandate by protecting complainants as though every \ncomplainant has been vi ctimized, without unfairness to the respondent. A presumption of non -responsibility does \nnot deprive a complainant of the protections given solely to complainants under § 106.44(a) and § 106.45, nor deprive a complainant of the benefits of the robust proce dural rights given equally to both parties during the \ngrievance process. \n873  \n      \n  \n \n    \n \n \n   \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n             \n                     \n               \n              \n                \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

Discussion : The Department appreciates commenters’ support for § 106.45(b)(1)(iv) and \nacknowledges the many commenters who shared personal experiences as respondents in Title IX proceedings where the investigation process made the commenter feel like the burden was on the respondent to prove non-responsibility rather than being presumed not responsible unless \nevidence showed otherwise.  \nThe Department disagrees with commenters who believed that the purpose of the \npresumption of non-responsibility is to favor respondents at the expense of complainants or that \na presumption of non- responsibility demonstrates animus or hos tility toward complainants. The \nDepartment does not seek to “perpetuate the myth of false reporting in Federal  policy,” nor does \nit desire “to protect the reputation and interests of the accused” at the expense of victims as some \ncommenters claimed . To the contrary, we seek to establish a fair grievance process for all parties, \n1051 Comment ers cited , e.g., Tyler Kingkade, When Colleges Threaten To Punish Students Who Report Sexual \nViolence , THE HUFFINGTON POST (Sept. 9, 2015) . \n848  \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n \n  \n    \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n              \n                 \n    \nA Federal court order vacated the following language in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i): “If a party or witness does \nto cross-examination at the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must not rely on any statement of that party  \nor witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility.”\nVictim Rights Law Center et al. v.

The § 106.45 grievance process, therefore , treats complainants and respondents equally in \nnearly every regard , with three exceptions (one imposing equitable treatment for both parties, \none applicable only to respondents, and one applicable only to complainants). The Department \ndisagrees with commenters who argued that any provision conferring a right or protection only to respondents treats complainants inequitably or constitutes sex discrimination against women. The sole provision that applies only to respondents (§ 106.45(b)(1)(iv) ) does not treat \ncomplainants inequitably because the provision helps ensure that the burden of proof remains on the recipient, not on the complainant (or respondent), and the presumption serves to reinforce correct application of whichever standard of evidence the recipient has selected . The Department \nalso notes that any person regardless of  sex may be a complainant or a respondent, and , thus, \nprovisions that treat complainants and respondents equitably based on party status or apply only to complainants or only to respondents for the purpose of fostering truth-seeking, do not discriminate ba sed on sex but rather distinguish interests unique to a person’s party status . \nThe Department is sensitive to the concerns from commenters that the experience of a \ngrievance process may indeed feel traumatizing or intimidating to complainants,\n477 yet the facts \nsurrounding sexual harassment incidents must be reliably determined in order to provide remedies to a victim.
