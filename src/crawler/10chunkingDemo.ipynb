Commenters also suggested\\nclarifying references to quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment as\\nthese two concepts, though useful, do not determine the issue of whether the\\nschool itself is considered responsible for the harassment.

If the school delays its response to this complaint and the victim  suffers additional effects of the harassment, such as missing additional pop  quizzes because she has to continue coming to class late, the school must  remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented if the  school had responded promptly and effectively. In this case, the appropriate  remedy may include such actions as calculating the student’s grade without  factoring in the student’s failure to take the quizzes, giving the student  another opportunity to take the quizzes, or arranging for an independent  assessment of the student’s work.\n",

      " In California-based educational institutions or workplaces receiving federal funding, where harassment or discrimination based on sex is reported, the following actions should be taken in accordance with Title IX implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reporting: The affected individual should report the incident to the designated Title IX coordinator or other responsible personnel as soon as possible.\n",
      "2. Investigation: Upon receiving a report, the institution must initiate a thorough investigation into the allegations.\n",
      "3. Remedial Action: If the investigation reveals that harassment or discrimination has occurred, prompt and effective action should be taken to address the situation.\n",
      "4. Confidentiality: All reports and investigations must be conducted in a confidential manner, ensuring privacy for all involved parties.\n",
      "5. Support Services: The institution should provide necessary resources and support services to help the affected individual cope with the impact of the harassment or discrimination.\n",
      "6. Retaliation: The institution is prohibited from retaliating against the reporting individual.\n",
      "7. Training: Regular training on Title IX policies, procedures, and creating an inclusive learning/working environment should be provided for students, faculty, and staff.\n",
      "8. Timely Response: All reports must be addressed in a timely manner.\n",
      "9. Communication: The affected individual should be kept informed throughout the investigation and remedial action process, with regular updates on progress.\n",
      "10. Record-keeping: The institution is required to maintain records of all Title IX reports, investigations, and remedial actions for at least seven years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When reporting harassment or discrimination through alternative means (third party or anonymous sources), the school's response will depend on various factors such as the credibility and specificity of the information, the seriousness of the alleged incident, and whether the affected individuals wish to pursue the matter. If it is deemed reasonable for the school to investigate and confirm the allegations, interim measures and appropriate responsive actions should be considered.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Based on the context provided, it seems that the individual has experienced gender-based harassment in an educational setting. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in education programs and activities operated by recipients of federal financial assistance. This includes sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based harassment that create a hostile environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to such incidents, California's Title IX regulations require schools to take prompt and effective action to investigate and address reports of sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination. The school must respond in a manner that is reasonably calculated to end the harassing behavior, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects on the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the individual reported that she was being subjected to gender-based harassment from her classmates during a sociology class at her college. The school should promptly investigate the incident, including interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence. If the investigation confirms that sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination has occurred, the school must take appropriate remedial measures to address the effects of the harassment on the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "These remedies may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Disciplinary action against the harasser(s): The school should take disciplinary action against the individuals who engaged in the harassing behavior. This could range from a warning to expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense and the individual's prior history.\n",
      "2. Counseling or support services for the victim: The school should offer counseling or other support services to help the victim cope with the effects of the harassment.\n",
      "3. Education and training for the student body: The school should provide education and training to all students about sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, and the importance of respecting the rights of others. This could include workshops, seminars, or other educational programs.\n",
      "4. Changes to school policies or practices: If necessary, the school may need to revise its policies or practices to prevent future incidents of sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination. For example, the school might establish a clear reporting mechanism for students to report incidents of harassment, or implement stricter disciplinary measures for offenders.\n",
      "5. Retaliation protection: The school must ensure that the victim is not retaliated against for reporting the harassment. This could include providing the victim with additional security measures or other protections to prevent further harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that this is just a general outline of potential remedies, and the specific actions taken by the school will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The individual in this example has bravely shared her experience, and it's crucial that schools take such reports seriously and respond appropriately to ensure a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      " In the context of California's Title IX implementation, if a student or employee experiences sexual harassment or assault, prompt action is required to eliminate the hostile environment and prevent further harm. Here are potential steps for addressing such incidents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reporting: Encourage the victim to report the incident(s) to the designated Title IX coordinator or human resources representative as soon as possible. This can be done through an online reporting system, a formal complaint, or a direct conversation.\n",
      "2. Investigation: Conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations, which may include interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence, and reviewing relevant policies and procedures. The investigation should be conducted in a timely manner with sensitivity to the victim's needs and concerns.\n",
      "3. Interim Measures: Implement interim measures during the investigation to protect the victim from further harm and ensure their safety. This may include providing counseling services, arranging for alternative work or class schedules, or implementing no-contact orders.\n",
      "4. Remedial Action: If sexual harassment or assault is found to have occurred, take remedial action to address the harm caused and prevent future incidents. This may involve disciplinary action against the harasser, providing training on sexual harassment prevention, or implementing new policies and procedures.\n",
      "5. Support Services: Offer appropriate support services to the victim throughout the investigation and resolution process. These services may include counseling, academic accommodations, or disability accommodations if applicable.\n",
      "6. Retaliation Protection: Ensure that the victim is not retaliated against for reporting the incident or participating in the investigation. Any retaliatory behavior should be promptly addressed and remedied.\n",
      "7. Follow-up: Check in with the victim to ensure they are receiving necessary support services and that recommended remedial actions have been effectively implemented. This may involve regular check-ins or progress reports.\n",
      "8. Training and Education: Provide ongoing training and education on sexual harassment prevention, consent, and healthy relationships for students and employees. This can help create a culture of respect and accountability that discourages sexual misconduct and supports survivors.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      " In response to your query regarding the resolution of unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, as described in the example you provided, under California's Title IX implementation, the following steps should be taken:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reporting: The individual experiencing the harassment (the complainant) should report the incident(s) to the Title IX Coordinator or designated campus or workplace authority as soon as possible. The report can be made verbally, in writing, or by email.\n",
      "2. Investigation: Upon receiving a report of sexual harassment, the Title IX Coordinator or designee will initiate an investigation into the allegations. This may include interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence, and reviewing relevant policies and procedures.\n",
      "3. Interim Measures: The school or workplace is required to take prompt and effective steps to protect the complainant from further harassment. This could include separating the parties involved, providing counseling services, adjusting work schedules, or implementing other measures as necessary.\n",
      "4. Formal Resolution: If the investigation determines that sexual harassment has occurred, the school or workplace will take appropriate action to remedy the situation. This may include disciplinary action against the harasser, providing remedial training, and offering resources for the complainant to help them cope with the effects of the harassment.\n",
      "5. Informal Resolution: If both parties agree, the school or workplace may offer an informal resolution process, such as mediation or counseling services, to help resolve the situation.\n",
      "6. Retaliation Protection: The school or workplace is prohibited from retaliating against the complainant for reporting sexual harassment or participating in the investigation.\n",
      "7. Record Keeping: The school or workplace must maintain records of all reports and investigations related to sexual harassment, as well as any actions taken to address the situation.\n",
      "8. Training: The school or workplace is required to provide regular training on Title IX policies and procedures, including sexual harassment prevention and response, to students, faculty, and staff.\n",
      "9. Confidentiality: The school or workplace will maintain confidentiality to the extent possible while still taking appropriate action to address the situation.\n",
      "10. Timely Response: The school or workplace must respond to reports of sexual harassment in a timely manner to ensure that the complainant is protected from further harm and that the harasser is held accountable for their actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, under California law, sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. It also includes gender-based harassment, which refers to unwelcome conduct based on an individual’s actual or perceived sex, including harassment based on gender identity or nonconformity with sex stereotypes. All forms of sex-based harassment are prohibited by Title IX. If you have experienced sexual harassment in a California workplace or educational institution, it is important to report the incident to the appropriate authorities and seek support from resources available to you.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      " In California, an individual experiencing gender-based harassment or discrimination based on sex stereotyping in an educational setting should follow these steps as outlined by Title IX regulations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Report the incident to the school or district's Title IX Coordinator as soon as possible. This can be done verbally, in writing, or by email. Provide as many details as possible about the incident, including the harasser's name, date, time, location, and any witnesses.\n",
      "2. The school or district will conduct a prompt and equitable investigation of the complaint. Interviews with the complainant, harasser, and witnesses may be part of this process. The individual has the right to have an advisor present during the investigation.\n",
      "3. If sex stereotyping harassment is found, the school or district will take appropriate action to remedy the situation. This could include disciplinary measures against the harasser, counseling or training for students and staff, or other preventative measures.\n",
      "4. The individual has the right to appeal the decision if they are not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation. The appeal process is outlined in the California Department of Education's Title IX regulations.\n",
      "5. If the situation remains unresolved through internal processes, the individual may file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education. OCR enforces Title IX in educational programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Title IX protects all students from sex-based harassment, regardless of their gender identity or expression. If someone identifies as a woman but does not conform to traditional gender stereotypes, they are still protected under Title IX. The same principles apply if the individual identifies as a man and is told they do not meet masculine expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, reporting sex stereotyping harassment or discrimination in an educational setting in California involves contacting the school or district's Title IX Coordinator, following the investigation process, and considering filing a complaint with OCR if necessary. The individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, free from discrimination based on sex stereotypes.\n",

       "'Here is the example of people\\'s experience of getting harassed: - \\n    \"A leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94 in my country published by so called \\x93experienced\\x94 psychotherapists contains a lot of pernicious gender stereotypes. The reason why I despair about living in my country is that girls get stereotyped as behaving one way and boys get stereotyped as behaving the opposite way, even when in reality there is a lot of overlap of behaviours between the sexes! In the leaflet, girls are automatically assumed to be \\x93vulnerable\\x94 and in need of \\x93empowering\\x94. This is kind of offensive and degrading to many young women who are capable and self sufficient. Some women do not view themselves as \\x93helpless victims\\x94, but instead as highly capable survivors! Calling girls \\x93vulnerable\\x94 or fragile doesn\\x92t help them deal with stuff in an adaptive or a resilient way. While it is true that some young women struggle with issues around eating (please don\\x92t use the pathologising words \\x93eating disorder\\x94 because it is society\\x92s expectations around food that are disordered, not the young women themselves). Once again, the fact that many young men also engage in anorexic or bulimic behaviours is conveniently ignored by the leaflet. This is sexist because young men are under pressure by the media too. Young men are pressurised to be lean and muscular by society and this cannot be ignored! In the leaflet, girls are called \\x93over conscientious and perfectionistic daughters\\x94. Seriously? What is wrong with doing things thoroughly and properly? Do people want girls to slap-dash and half finish tasks? Would you want an airline pilot who didn\\x92t do safety checks before take-off, a doctor who prescribed you the wrong drug or a nuclear power plant worker who was not conscientious? I mean come on, some jobs require stringent \\x93perfectionism\\x94 or you get fired or sued because a slap-dash attitude would cost lives! In Chemistry Class, I had to titrate chemicals according to strict concentration values in solution. If I measured the mass of chemicals wrong or used the wrong volume of distilled water, the experiment would not work and the results would have been useless. I had to also be thorough when writing up lab reports because marks would be deducted from my final grade if I was not. It is fantastic to aim for perfection because it meant that I obtained maximum marks possible for the planning part of the Chemistry Coursework. Nothing beats getting 100% marks on a task, it is truly an awesome feeling! So no, I don\\x92t think that girls should be denied the opportunity to excel by people who call them \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94. Heck, what this world so desperately needs is more high achieving young women! Even TV competitions such as \\x93dress making\\x94 or \\x93bake off\\x94 require precise measurements and the right amount of ingredients for the clothes to actually fit or cakes not to explode in the oven respectively. Lots of women take part in these shows and do well. Please, instead of pathologising girls and young women for their hard work and diligence, praise them for it! Give credit where credit is due for crying out loud! I do sense that in my country there is a culture of anti intellectualism and dare I say it, people are jealous of young women\\x92s achievements, so some teachers, parents and \\x93professionals\\x94 tell girls that they are \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94 or \\x93over contentious\\x94 because I don\\x92t know they are envious of the female youth today? My grandmother liked to do things thoroughly and properly as part of her job. She would be rolling in her grave now if she heard that young women are actively being discouraged from being conscientious and doing a thorough job by \\x93well meaning adults\\x94. In some Asian countries, such effort and thoroughness by women would be praised and actively encouraged. I am amazed at how young women and men are encouraged to strive to do the best the can and aim for high standards in some Asian countries. The toys, the games, the TV shows, everything encourage people to try hard and improve themselves. Young women in some Asian countries are told that perfection is a virtue that they should strive for. While this has the unfortunate effect of some Asian women wanting plastic surgery, it does mean that Asian women are lauded for the \\x93perfection\\x94 of the hard work that they do in intellectual pursuits. In the leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94, boys are unfairly stereotyped as all being \\x93laid back \\x91do it all at the last minute\\x92 lads\\x94. I have seen some boys spend hours researching in the library weeks in advance of a deadline. Lots of these young men were boys of Asian origin, but there were definitely some white Caucasian boys and all other ethnicities of boys studying hard too! This is why it is sexist and unfair to label the entire male gender as \\x93laid back\\x94 and lazy in this way. Sometimes being \\x93laid back\\x94 isn\\x92t lazy at all! Sometimes one needs time to mull over and consider all options carefully before reaching a decision. Some people like to look at the \\x93big picture\\x94 of the situation before they focus on the details. I have also met sone \\x93laid back last minute\\x94 girls who were high achievers! Fun fact: a close female friend of mine had a habit of leaving her homework until the night before it was due. Despite her procrastination, she always ended up getting A grades. Explain that then \\x93psychology experts\\x94! Oh wait\\x85you can\\x92t\\x85 I have also met some very lazy, unconscientious girls who often didn\\x92t submit their homework at all! Some girls really are bored and disengaged with school as the \\x93Lauren Cooper\\x94 \\x93Am I bovvered?\\x94 sketches sadly parody. This leaflet is part of the problem, not part of the solution. If you stereotype males as lazy and disengaged with studying, it may become a self fulfilling prophesy because some adults had low expectations of them! Wouldn\\x92t it be better instead to encourage everyone to be thorough, aim for high standards and do their best regardless of whether they are female, male or other? Just sayin\\x92\\x85 \"\\n    Can you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in california, \\n    considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the california State\\'s Title IX specific resolution.'"

       "EvaluationResult(query=None, contexts=['This is consistent with the Court\\'s underlying concern\\nMost commenters acknowledged that OCR has provided useful factors to determine\\nwhether harassing conduct took place \"in the context of providing aid,\\nbenefits, or services.\" However, some commenters stated that additional\\nclarity and examples regarding the issue were needed. Commenters also suggested\\nclarifying references to quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment as\\nthese two concepts, though useful, do not determine the issue of whether the\\nschool itself is considered responsible for the harassment. We agree with\\nthese concerns and have made significant revisions to the sections \"Harassment\\nthat Denies or Limits a Student\\'s Ability to Participate in or Benefit from\\nthe Education Program\" and \"Harassment by Teachers and Other Employees\" to\\nGender-based Harassment, Including Harassment Predicated on Sex-stereotyping\\nSeveral commenters requested that we expand the discussion and include examples\\nof gender-based harassment predicated on sex stereotyping. Some commenters\\nalso argued that gender-based harassment should be considered sexual harassment,\\nand that we have \"artificially\" restricted the guidance only to harassment\\nin the form of conduct of a sexual nature, thus, implying that gender-based\\nharassment is of less concern and should be evaluated differently.\\nWe have not further expanded this section because, while we are also concerned\\nwith the important issue of gender-based harassment, we believe that harassment\\nof a sexual nature raises unique and sufficiently important issues that distinguish\\nit from other types of gender-based harassment and warrants its own guidance.\\nNevertheless, we have clarified this section of the guidance in several ways.\\nThe guidance clarifies that gender-based harassment, including that predicated\\non sex-stereotyping, is covered by Title IX if it is sufficiently serious to\\ndeny or limit a student\\'s ability to participate in or benefit from the program.\\nThus, it can be discrimination on the basis of sex to harass a student on the\\nbasis of the victim\\'s failure to conform to stereotyped notions of masculinity\\nand femininity.

In determining\\nwhether harassment is actionable, both Davis and the Department tell schools\\nto look at the \"constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,\\nand relationships\" (526 U.S. At 651 (citing Oncale )), and the Davis Court\\ncited approvingly to the underlying core factors described in the 1997 guidance\\nfor evaluating the context of the harassment.', \"Thus, OCR would consider this an example of conduct\\nthat is occurring in the context of the employee's responsibilities to provide\\nOther examples of sexual harassment of a student occurring in the context\\nof an employee's responsibilities for providing aid, benefits, or services\\ninclude, but are not limited to -- a faculty member at a university's medical\\nschool conditions an intern's evaluation on submission to his sexual advances\\nand then gives her a poor evaluation for rejecting the advances; a high school\\ndrama instructor does not give a student a part in a play because she has not\\nresponded to sexual overtures from the instructor; a faculty member withdraws\\napproval of research funds for her assistant because he has rebuffed her advances;\\na journalism professor who supervises a college newspaper continually and inappropriately\\ntouches a student editor in a sexual manner, causing the student to resign\\nfrom the newspaper staff; and a teacher repeatedly asks a ninth grade student\\nto stay after class and attempts to engage her in discussions about sex and\\nher personal experiences while they are alone in the classroom, causing the\\nstudent to stop coming to class.

Reporting: The individual should report the incident to their educational institution's or workplace's designated Title IX coordinator as soon as possible. This can typically be done via an online reporting form, email, or by contacting the Title IX office directly.\\n2. Investigation: Upon receiving a report, the institution or workplace is required to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation into the allegations. This may involve interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence, and providing both parties with opportunities to share their perspectives.\\n3. Remedial Action: If the investigation determines that sex-based harassment has occurred, the institution or workplace must take appropriate remedial action to address the situation. This could include disciplinary measures against the harasser, counseling or support services for the affected individual, and changes to policies or procedures to prevent future incidents.\\n4. Retaliation Protection: Title IX also prohibits retaliation against individuals who report harassment or participate in investigations. The institution or workplace must take steps to protect the reporting party from further harm or intimidation.\\n5. Training and Education: California educational institutions and workplaces are required to provide regular training and education on Title IX policies, procedures, and maintaining a safe and inclusive learning or working environment for all students and employees.\\n\\nThese steps aim to ensure that individuals in California are able to report and seek resolution for incidents of sex-based harassment, including those occurring through social media platforms like Twitter.

As a result, she has missed some  pop quizzes. If the school delays its response to this complaint and the victim  suffers additional effects of the harassment, such as missing additional pop  quizzes because she has to continue coming to class late, the school must  remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented if the  school had responded promptly and effectively. In this case, the appropriate  remedy may include such actions as calculating the student’s grade without  factoring in the student’s failure to take the quizzes, giving the student  another opportunity to take the quizzes, or arranging for an independent  assessment of the student’s work.\\nAnybody who sees sexual harassment occur should report it;  the individual need not be the victim of the harassment. Schools should ensure  that employees clearly understand the extent of their responsibilities for  reporting sexual harassment.\\nThe harassment should be  reported to a responsible school employee, such as a teacher, principal,  faculty member, administrator, security officer, affirmative action officer, or  professional staff member in the office of student affairs.

       " 'Sex-based harassment can take multiple forms.  Harassers can be students, school staff, or even someone visiting the school,  such as a student or employee from another school. Sexual harassment (including  sexual violence) is a form of sex-based harassment.\\nSexual harassment refers to sex-based conduct  that satisfies one or more of the following: (1)\\xa0quid pro quo\\xa0harassment  by an employee of an educational institution—meaning that an employee offers  something to a student or other person in exchange for sexual conduct; (2)  unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would find to be so severe,  pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal  access to an education program or activity; or (3) sexual assault (as defined  in the\\xa0Clery Act), dating violence, domestic  violence, or stalking (as defined in the\\xa0Violence Against Women Act). Each of these categories of misconduct is a  serious violation that jeopardizes a victim’s equal access to education.\\nWhat are the responsibilities of school districts, colleges, and universities under Title IX to address sex-based harassment?\\nWhen a school has actual knowledge of sexual harassment in any of its programs or activities that take place in United States, it must respond promptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. A school is deliberately indifferent if its response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The Title IX Coordinator must promptly contact the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures, regardless of whether a formal complaint is filed, and to explain the process for filing a formal complaint.\\nIn addition, if a formal complaint is filed, either by the complainant or the Title IX Coordinator, a school must:\\nFor more information on the obligations, see  34 C.F.R. § 106.44(a) and the Questions and Answers resource and Appendix on the Title IX Regulations on Sexual Harassment.\\nHow do educational institutions balance their Title IX obligations with individuals’ First Amendment rights?\\nOCR has consistently reaffirmed that the  Federal civil rights laws it enforces protect students from prohibited  discrimination, including unlawful harassment, and are not intended to restrict  expressive activities or speech protected under the U.S. Constitution’s First  Amendment.\\nSchools can protect students from verbal  harassment without running afoul of students’ and staff First Amendment rights.']"

       "  'This is consistent with the Court\\'s underlying concern\\nMost commenters acknowledged that OCR has provided useful factors to determine\\nwhether harassing conduct took place \"in the context of providing aid,\\nbenefits, or services.\" However, some commenters stated that additional\\nclarity and examples regarding the issue were needed. Commenters also suggested\\nclarifying references to quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment as\\nthese two concepts, though useful, do not determine the issue of whether the\\nschool itself is considered responsible for the harassment. We agree with\\nthese concerns and have made significant revisions to the sections \"Harassment\\nthat Denies or Limits a Student\\'s Ability to Participate in or Benefit from\\nthe Education Program\" and \"Harassment by Teachers and Other Employees\" to\\nGender-based Harassment, Including Harassment Predicated on Sex-stereotyping\\nSeveral commenters requested that we expand the discussion and include examples\\nof gender-based harassment predicated on sex stereotyping. Some commenters\\nalso argued that gender-based harassment should be considered sexual harassment,\\nand that we have \"artificially\" restricted the guidance only to harassment\\nin the form of conduct of a sexual nature, thus, implying that gender-based\\nharassment is of less concern and should be evaluated differently.\\nWe have not further expanded this section because, while we are also concerned\\nwith the important issue of gender-based harassment, we believe that harassment\\nof a sexual nature raises unique and sufficiently important issues that distinguish\\nit from other types of gender-based harassment and warrants its own guidance.\\nNevertheless, we have clarified this section of the guidance in several ways.\\nThe guidance clarifies that gender-based harassment, including that predicated\\non sex-stereotyping, is covered by Title IX if it is sufficiently serious to\\ndeny or limit a student\\'s ability to participate in or benefit from the program.\\nThus, it can be discrimination on the basis of sex to harass a student on the\\nbasis of the victim\\'s failure to conform to stereotyped notions of masculinity\\nand femininity. Although this type of harassment is not covered by the guidance,\\nif it is sufficiently serious, gender-based harassment is a school\\'s responsibility,\\nand the same standards generally will apply.\\nExample  1:   A college professor sexually harassed a student in his or her class in the  context of the professor’s duty to provide services to the student.  Consequently, the student was unable to concentrate during class and did not  learn the course material. To remedy the effects of the harassment, the school  may be required to take such actions as:\\nExample  2: A high school student informs the school  that another student in her class has been sexually harassing her and that, to  avoid him, she has been coming to class late. As a result, she has missed some  pop quizzes. If the school delays its response to this complaint and the victim  suffers additional effects of the harassment, such as missing additional pop  quizzes because she has to continue coming to class late, the school must  remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented if the  school had responded promptly and effectively. In this case, the appropriate  remedy may include such actions as calculating the student’s grade without  factoring in the student’s failure to take the quizzes, giving the student  another opportunity to take the quizzes, or arranging for an independent  assessment of the student’s work.\\nAnybody who sees sexual harassment occur should report it;  the individual need not be the victim of the harassment. Schools should ensure  that employees clearly understand the extent of their responsibilities for  reporting sexual harassment.\\nThe harassment should be  reported to a responsible school employee, such as a teacher, principal,  faculty member, administrator, security officer, affirmative action officer, or  professional staff member in the office of student affairs. Additionally, as  every school must have a Title IX coordinator, the harassment can be reported to this individual as well.\\nA student, parent, or other individual also may file a  complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights  (OCR), as explained below.\\nTitle IX also protects students from retaliation. The school  must take steps to prevent the alleged harasser or anybody else at the school  from retaliating against the victim. Such steps include informing students that Title IX protects them from retaliation, making sure that victims know  how to report any future problems, and making follow-up inquiries to see if  there have been any new incidents. It also may be appropriate to counsel the  harasser to ensure that he or she understands that retaliation is prohibited.\\nThe professor also assigns students to write their own\\nmaterials, which are read in class. Some of the student essays contain sexually\\nderogatory themes about women. Several female students complain to the Dean\\nof Students that the materials and related classroom discussion have created\\na sexually hostile environment for women in the class. What must the school\\nAnswer:  Academic discourse in this example is protected by the First Amendment\\neven if it is offensive to individuals. Thus, Title IX would not require the\\nschool to discipline the professor or to censor the reading list or related\\nExample 2:  A group of male students repeatedly targets a female student\\nfor harassment during the bus ride home from school, including making explicit\\nsexual comments about her body, passing around drawings that depict her engaging\\nin sexual conduct, and, on several occasions, attempting to follow her home\\noff the bus. The female student and her parents complain to the principal\\nthat the male students conduct has created a hostile environment for girls\\non the bus and that they fear for their daughter\\'s safety. What must a school\\nAnswer:  Threatening and intimidating actions targeted at a particular student\\nor group of students, even though they contain elements of speech, are not\\nprotected by the First Amendment. The school must take prompt and effective\\nactions, including disciplinary action if necessary, to stop the harassment\\naddress sexual harassment of employees, although that conduct may be prohibited\\nby Title IX. 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; 34 CFR part 106, subpart E.

We have also added an endnote\\nregarding Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that sex stereotyping\\nSeveral commenters also suggested that we state that sexual and non-sexual\\n(but gender-based) harassment should not be evaluated separately in determining\\nwhether a hostile environment exists. We note that both the proposed revised\\nguidance and the final revised guidance indicate in several places that incidents\\nof sexual harassment and non-sexual, gender-based harassment can be combined\\nto determine whether a hostile environment has been created. We also note\\nthat sufficiently serious harassment of a sexual nature remains covered by\\nTitle IX, as explained in the guidance, even though the hostile environment\\nOne commenter urged OCR to provide distinct definitions of sexual harassment\\nto be used in administrative enforcement as distinguished from criteria used\\nto maintain private actions for monetary damages. We disagree. First, as\\ndiscussed in the preamble to the proposed revised guidance, the definition\\nof hostile environment sexual harassment used by the Court in Davis is consistent\\nwith the definition found in the proposed guidance. Although the terms used\\nby the Court in Davis are in some ways different from the words used to define\\nhostile environment harassment in the 1997 guidance (see, e.g., 62 FR 12041, \"conduct\\nof a sexual nature is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit\\na student\\'s ability to participate in or benefit from the education program,\\nor to create a hostile or abusive educational environment\"), the definitions\\nare consistent. Both the Court\\'s and the Department\\'s definitions are contextual\\ndescriptions intended to capture the same concept - that under Title IX, the\\nconduct must be sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student\\'s\\nability to participate in or benefit from the school\\'s program. In determining\\nwhether harassment is actionable, both Davis and the Department tell schools\\nto look at the \"constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,\\nand relationships\" (526 U.S. At 651 (citing Oncale )), and the Davis Court\\ncited approvingly to the underlying core factors described in the 1997 guidance\\nfor evaluating the context of the harassment.\\nThus, OCR would consider this an example of conduct\\nthat is occurring in the context of the employee\\'s responsibilities to provide\\nOther examples of sexual harassment of a student occurring in the context\\nof an employee\\'s responsibilities for providing aid, benefits, or services\\ninclude, but are not limited to -- a faculty member at a university\\'s medical\\nschool conditions an intern\\'s evaluation on submission to his sexual advances\\nand then gives her a poor evaluation for rejecting the advances; a high school\\ndrama instructor does not give a student a part in a play because she has not\\nresponded to sexual overtures from the instructor; a faculty member withdraws\\napproval of research funds for her assistant because he has rebuffed her advances;\\na journalism professor who supervises a college newspaper continually and inappropriately\\ntouches a student editor in a sexual manner, causing the student to resign\\nfrom the newspaper staff; and a teacher repeatedly asks a ninth grade student\\nto stay after class and attempts to engage her in discussions about sex and\\nher personal experiences while they are alone in the classroom, causing the\\nstudent to stop coming to class. In each of these cases, the school is responsible\\nfor the discriminatory conduct, including taking prompt and effective action\\nto end the harassment, prevent it from recurring, and remedy the effects of\\nSometimes harassment of a student by an employee in the school\\'s program does\\nnot take place in the context of the employee\\'s provision of aid, benefits,\\nor services, but nevertheless is sufficiently serious to create a hostile educational\\nenvironment. An example of this conduct might occur if a faculty member in\\nthe history department at a university, over the course of several weeks, repeatedly\\ntouches and makes sexually suggestive remarks to a graduate engineering student\\nwhile waiting at a stop for the university shuttle bus, riding on the bus,\\nand upon exiting the bus. As a result, the student stops using the campus\\nshuttle and walks the very long distances between her classes. In this case,\\nthe school is not directly responsible for the harassing conduct because it\\ndid not occur in the context of the employee\\'s responsibilities for the provision\\nof aid, benefits, or services to students. However, the conduct is sufficiently\\nserious to deny or limit the student in her ability to participate in or benefit\\nfrom the recipient\\'s program. Thus, the school has a duty, upon notice of\\ntake prompt and effective action to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence.\\n1560, 1564-65, 1575 (N.D.

Harassers can be students, school staff, or even someone visiting the school,  such as a student or employee from another school. Sexual harassment (including  sexual violence) is a form of sex-based harassment.\\nSexual harassment refers to sex-based conduct  that satisfies one or more of the following: (1)\\xa0quid pro quo\\xa0harassment  by an employee of an educational institution—meaning that an employee offers  something to a student or other person in exchange for sexual conduct; (2)  unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would find to be so severe,  pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal  access to an education program or activity; or (3) sexual assault (as defined  in the\\xa0Clery Act), dating violence, domestic  violence, or stalking (as defined in the\\xa0Violence Against Women Act). Each of these categories of misconduct is a  serious violation that jeopardizes a victim’s equal access to education.\\nWhat are the responsibilities of school districts, colleges, and universities under Title IX to address sex-based harassment?\\nWhen a school has actual knowledge of sexual harassment in any of its programs or activities that take place in United States, it must respond promptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. A school is deliberately indifferent if its response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The Title IX Coordinator must promptly contact the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures, regardless of whether a formal complaint is filed, and to explain the process for filing a formal complaint.\\nIn addition, if a formal complaint is filed, either by the complainant or the Title IX Coordinator, a school must:\\nFor more information on the obligations, see  34 C.F.R. § 106.44(a) and the Questions and Answers resource and Appendix on the Title IX Regulations on Sexual Harassment.\\nHow do educational institutions balance their Title IX obligations with individuals’ First Amendment rights?\\nOCR has consistently reaffirmed that the  Federal civil rights laws it enforces protect students from prohibited  discrimination, including unlawful harassment, and are not intended to restrict  expressive activities or speech protected under the U.S. Constitution’s First  Amendment.\\nSchools can protect students from verbal  harassment without running afoul of students’ and staff First Amendment rights.\\n']]"

Some commenters\\nalso argued that gender-based harassment should be considered sexual harassment,\\nand that we have \"artificially\" restricted the guidance only to harassment\\nin the form of conduct of a sexual nature, thus, implying that gender-based\\nharassment is of less concern and should be evaluated differently.\\nWe have not further expanded this section because, while we are also concerned\\nwith the important issue of gender-based harassment, we believe that harassment\\nof a sexual nature raises unique and sufficiently important issues that distinguish\\nit from other types of gender-based harassment and warrants its own guidance.\\nNevertheless, we have clarified this section of the guidance in several ways.\\nThe guidance clarifies that gender-based harassment, including that predicated\\non sex-stereotyping, is covered by Title IX if it is sufficiently serious to\\ndeny or limit a student\\'s ability to participate in or benefit from the program.\\nThus, it can be discrimination on the basis of sex to harass a student on the\\nbasis of the victim\\'s failure to conform to stereotyped notions of masculinity\\nand femininity. Although this type of harassment is not covered by the guidance,\\nif it is sufficiently serious, gender-based harassment is a school\\'s responsibility,\\nand the same standards generally will apply.', 'Example  1:   A college professor sexually harassed a student in his or her class in the  context of the professor’s duty to provide services to the student.  Consequently, the student was unable to concentrate during class and did not  learn the course material. To remedy the effects of the harassment, the school  may be required to take such actions as:\\nExample  2: A high school student informs the school  that another student in her class has been sexually harassing her and that, to  avoid him, she has been coming to class late. As a result, she has missed some  pop quizzes. If the school delays its response to this complaint and the victim  suffers additional effects of the harassment, such as missing additional pop  quizzes because she has to continue coming to class late, the school must  remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented if the  school had responded promptly and effectively. In this case, the appropriate  remedy may include such actions as calculating the student’s grade without  factoring in the student’s failure to take the quizzes, giving the student  another opportunity to take the quizzes, or arranging for an independent  assessment of the student’s work.\\nAnybody who sees sexual harassment occur should report it;  the individual need not be the victim of the harassment. Schools should ensure  that employees clearly understand the extent of their responsibilities for  reporting sexual harassment.\\nThe harassment should be  reported to a responsible school employee, such as a teacher, principal,  faculty member, administrator, security officer, affirmative action officer, or  professional staff member in the office of student affairs. Additionally, as  every school must have a Title IX coordinator, the harassment can be reported to this individual as well.\\nA student, parent, or other individual also may file a  complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights  (OCR), as explained below.\\nTitle IX also protects students from retaliation. The school  must take steps to prevent the alleged harasser or anybody else at the school  from retaliating against the victim. Such steps include informing students that Title IX protects them from retaliation, making sure that victims know  how to report any future problems, and making follow-up inquiries to see if  there have been any new incidents. It also may be appropriate to counsel the  harasser to ensure that he or she understands that retaliation is prohibited.', \"The professor also assigns students to write their own\\nmaterials, which are read in class.

First, as\\ndiscussed in the preamble to the proposed revised guidance, the definition\\nof hostile environment sexual harassment used by the Court in Davis is consistent\\nwith the definition found in the proposed guidance.

Both the Court\\'s and the Department\\'s definitions are contextual\\ndescriptions intended to capture the same concept - that under Title IX, the\\nconduct must be sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student\\'s\\nability to participate in or benefit from the school\\'s program. In determining\\nwhether harassment is actionable, both Davis and the Department tell schools\\nto look at the \"constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,\\nand relationships\" (526 U.S. At 651 (citing Oncale )), and the Davis Court\\ncited approvingly to the underlying core factors described in the 1997 guidance\\nfor evaluating the context of the harassment.', \"Thus, OCR would consider this an example of conduct\\nthat is occurring in the context of the employee's responsibilities to provide\\nOther examples of sexual harassment of a student occurring in the context\\nof an employee's responsibilities for providing aid, benefits, or services\\ninclude, but are not limited to -- a faculty member at a university's medical\\nschool conditions an intern's evaluation on submission to his sexual advances\\nand then gives her a poor evaluation for rejecting the advances; a high school\\ndrama instructor does not give a student a part in a play because she has not\\nresponded to sexual overtures from the instructor; a faculty member withdraws\\napproval of research funds for her assistant because he has rebuffed her advances;\\na journalism professor who supervises a college newspaper continually and inappropriately\\ntouches a student editor in a sexual manner, causing the student to resign\\nfrom the newspaper staff; and a teacher repeatedly asks a ninth grade student\\nto stay after class and attempts to engage her in discussions about sex and\\nher personal experiences while they are alone in the classroom, causing the\\nstudent to stop coming to class.

As a result, the student stops using the campus\\nshuttle and walks the very long distances between her classes. In this case,\\nthe school is not directly responsible for the harassing conduct because it\\ndid not occur in the context of the employee's responsibilities for the provision\\nof aid, benefits, or services to students. However, the conduct is sufficiently\\nserious to deny or limit the student in her ability to participate in or benefit\\nfrom the recipient's program.

This could include disciplinary measures against the harasser, counseling or support services for the affected individual, and changes to policies or procedures to prevent future incidents.\\n4. Retaliation Protection: Title IX also prohibits retaliation against individuals who report harassment or participate in investigations.

As a result, she has missed some  pop quizzes. If the school delays its response to this complaint and the victim  suffers additional effects of the harassment, such as missing additional pop  quizzes because she has to continue coming to class late, the school must  remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented if the  school had responded promptly and effectively. In this case, the appropriate  remedy may include such actions as calculating the student’s grade without  factoring in the student’s failure to take the quizzes, giving the student  another opportunity to take the quizzes, or arranging for an independent  assessment of the student’s work.\\nAnybody who sees sexual harassment occur should report it;  the individual need not be the victim of the harassment. Schools should ensure  that employees clearly understand the extent of their responsibilities for  reporting sexual harassment.\\nThe harassment should be  reported to a responsible school employee, such as a teacher, principal,  faculty member, administrator, security officer, affirmative action officer, or  professional staff member in the office of student affairs. Additionally, as  every school must have a Title IX coordinator, the harassment can be reported to this individual as well.\\nA student, parent, or other individual also may file a  complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights  (OCR), as explained below.\\nTitle IX also protects students from retaliation.
