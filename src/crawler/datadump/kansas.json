This might include reassigning duties or work areas, providing additional security measures, or implementing no-contact orders.\n4. Disciplinary Action: If the investigation confirms that sexual harassment occurred, the employer will take appropriate disciplinary action against the harasser, which could include termination of employment, suspension, demotion, or other consequences as warranted by the severity and frequency of the harassing behavior.\n5. Remedial Action: The employer should take steps to prevent future incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace, such as providing training on sexual harassment policies and procedures, reviewing and updating anti-harassment policies, and addressing any underlying issues that may have contributed to the harassing environment.\n6.

On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone.

Report the incident: If the harassment or discrimination is occurring in an educational setting, students should report the incident to their school's Title IX coordinator or another designated campus authority. In a workplace, employees should report the incident to their employer's human resources department or supervisor.\n\n2. Seek support: Students can also seek support from various resources such as student organizations, counseling services, or advocacy groups. Employees can reach out to employee assistance programs or labor unions for guidance. In Maryland, there is the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR) which offers assistance and resources for individuals experiencing discrimination.\n\n3. Document the incident: Keep records of all interactions related to the harassment or discrimination, including dates, times, locations, and names of any witnesses. This information can be valuable during investigations and potential legal proceedings.\n\n4.

For employees, they have 180 days to file a charge with the EEOC and 6 months to file a charge with Maryland Commission on Civil Rights.\n\n6. Cooperate with investigations: Be prepared to cooperate fully with investigations, provide all necessary documentation, and be available for interviews. Remember that the outcome of the investigation will depend on the evidence collected.\n\n7. Consider seeking legal representation: If the harassment or discrimination continues despite reporting and filing formal complaints, consider consulting an attorney specializing in Title IX cases to discuss potential legal options. In Maryland, attorneys such as Ronald P. Jackson, Thecla Bethel, George Bush II, Carin E. Golze, Jonathan A. Webb, Stan Brown, Joseph M. Owens, Victoria Heyliger, Kathleen A.

In Maryland, the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR) enforces Title IX in educational institutions, ensuring equal access to education for all students regardless of their sex.\n\nIf an individual experiences harassment or discrimination based on their sex in an educational setting in Maryland, they may file a complaint with MCCR within 300 days of the alleged unlawful incident. The intake unit will contact the complainant to schedule an interview with one of the trained intake officers. During this interview, the individual must complete the process by signing and returning any necessary documents, including the Charge of Discrimination, for the complaint to be officially filed.\n\nOnce a formal complaint is filed, the investigation unit will review the case and take appropriate action based on their findings. This may include issuing informal resolutions, facilitating mediation or conciliation sessions, conducting hearings, or taking other legal measures if necessary. The specific resolution will depend on the nature of the alleged harassment or discrimination and the outcome of the investigation.\n\nIn cases that occur in workplaces, individuals should contact the Maryland Commission on Human Rights (MCHR), which enforces anti-discrimination laws in employment. The process for filing a complaint with MCHR is similar to filing one with MCCR, and individuals must file within 180 days of the alleged unlawful incident.\n\nRegardless of whether the harassment or discrimination occurs in an educational setting or a workplace, it's important for individuals to remember that they are not alone, and there are resources available to support them.

Many institutions and workplaces have policies and procedures in place for reporting and addressing sexual harassment, including providing resources and support to the complainant. The individual should familiarize themselves with these policies and procedures and follow them carefully.\n\nIf the issue is not resolved through internal reporting processes, the individual may file a formal complaint with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR). Complaints of sexual harassment must be filed within 300 days of the alleged incident for employment matters and within one year for housing and public accommodations matters.\n\nThe MCCR will investigate the allegations and attempt to resolve the matter through informal methods, such as mediation or conciliation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the Commission may take further legal action against the perpetrator or the responsible entity.\n\nIt's important to note that Maryland law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who are victims of sexual harassment, including providing a safe working environment and taking immediate corrective action when harassment is reported.\n\nIn the case described above, the individual may want to consider reporting the incident to their supervisor or human resources department if they have not already done so, and familiarizing themselves with their employer's sexual harassment policies and procedures. If they feel uncomfortable reporting internally, they may also consider filing a complaint with the MCCR.\n\nRemember that confidentiality and support resources are available for individuals who experience sexual harassment or discrimination.

On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone.
