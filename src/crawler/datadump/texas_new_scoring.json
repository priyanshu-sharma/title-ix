[{"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"When I was 17, I worked in a clothing store that sold both mens and womens clothing, as well as some unisex items. I was working overtime in the evening, around 8.30pm during the winter so it was already dark. I was by myself on the shop floor as my manager was cashing up in the stock room, when a man in his late 50s/early 60s came in and started asking about the winter boots we had on special offer. We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said \u0093Whilst you\u0092re down there, why don\u0092t you take one for the team?\u0094. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn\u0092t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just \u0091ignore it and don\u0092t get upset by it\u0092!

This includes all relevant information concerning the incident, such as dates, locations, individuals involved, and descriptions of the behavior.\n\n2. Confidential Reporting: If the person is a designated confidential resource at the institution or workplace, they may report only the type of incident and not disclose any additional identifying information about the victim. They are still required to make a report under Texas law but will maintain confidentiality.\n\n3. Investigation Process: Once reported, the Title IX coordinator will initiate an investigation into the matter.

The reporting person will be informed of the outcome and any remedial measures taken to address the situation.\n\n5. Confidentiality: Throughout the process, confidentiality will be maintained as much as possible while still following legal requirements and ensuring a thorough investigation. The Title IX coordinator may need to share information with specific individuals or entities on a need-to-know basis but will take steps to minimize sharing personal details about the reporting person.\n\n6. Record Keeping: The institution is required to keep records of all reports, investigations, and disciplinary actions taken under Texas law. Reports may be shared with the chief executive officer, governing body, and posted on the institution's website but will not identify any individuals involved except for disciplinary actions taken against the perpetrator.\n\n7.

On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn\u0092t exist. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in texas, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

The seriousness of the alleged incident, any previous reports of similar behavior from the perpetrator, and potential risks to the safety of the community are all factors that the institution must consider when deciding whether or not to investigate.\n\nIf an individual requests that the investigation be halted, the institution may still choose to investigate while upholding confidentiality requirements. The institution is also obligated to take steps to protect the health and safety of its community in relation to the alleged incident. The institution must inform the alleged victim of its decision regarding the investigation.\n\nThe individual described in the query had experienced harassment when she was younger, which unfortunately still occurs in today's society.

I saw many of the same clients regularly, day after day. At least two middle-aged men often would touch my shoulder for no reason while we exchanged pleasantries as they dropped off their dogs.

Please provide the texas state specific resolution.", "Response": " In the scenario provided, an individual named \"I\" has experienced unwanted physical contact at a workplace, specifically a doggie daycare. Two middle-aged men were reportedly the perpetrators of this behavior. Title IX is primarily associated with education institutions and sexual harassment or assault cases. However, it's important to note that the Texas legislation (Sec. 51.252) we have been provided discusses reporting requirements for postsecondary educational institution employees who witness or receive information regarding incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking.\n\nGiven the context and query, let's identify potential roles based on the scenario:\n\n1. The individual \"I\" is a victim in this situation but does not meet the criteria to be an employee as defined by the Texas legislation (Sec. 51.252).\n2. The middle-aged men are possible perpetrators of harassment, but they might or might not be employees as defined by the Texas legislation (Sec. 51.252) in a postsecondary educational institution setting.\n\nSince the query involves a workplace and the Title IX context provided pertains to education institutions, let's explore some possible solutions based on general workplace harassment policies and relevant Texas state laws:\n\n1. Reporting: If the doggie daycare falls under Texas state jurisdiction, it should have a harassment reporting policy in place. The individual \"I\" could report the incidents to their supervisor or HR department if they feel comfortable doing so. They can describe the situation, mention how it made them feel and request that appropriate action be taken to prevent future occurrences.\n2. Confidential Reporting: If the individual wishes to report anonymously or does not want to directly address the situation with their employer, they could consider reporting the incidents to a person designated as a confidential contact within the organization, such as an HR representative or someone in a similar role. In Texas, this might include a counselor or mental health professional under certain circumstances (Section 51.252c).\n3. Escalation: If the behavior continues despite reporting or if the situation escalates, the individual could consider filing a formal complaint with the appropriate state labor or human rights agency. In Texas, this would be the Texas Workforce Commission - Civil Rights Division.\n4. Support: The individual should also consider seeking emotional support from trusted friends, family members, or professional counselors during and after the situation to help cope with any negative emotions or stress.\n5. Prevention: To prevent future occurrences, it's important for workplaces, including doggie daycares, to have clear policies regarding workplace harassment and discrimination. Employees should be trained on these policies, and there should be a reporting mechanism in place that allows individuals to report incidents confidentially and without fear of retaliation.\n\nOverall, while the specific Title IX legislation provided might not directly apply to this scenario given its context in a workplace instead of an educational institution, there are still general steps that can be taken based on Texas state laws and best practices for addressing harassment and discrimination in any workplace setting.", "helpful_score": " I would rate the information provided as a 7.
