[{"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"When I was 17, I worked in a clothing store that sold both mens and womens clothing, as well as some unisex items. I was working overtime in the evening, around 8.30pm during the winter so it was already dark. I was by myself on the shop floor as my manager was cashing up in the stock room, when a man in his late 50s/early 60s came in and started asking about the winter boots we had on special offer. We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said \u0093Whilst you\u0092re down there, why don\u0092t you take one for the team?\u0094. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn\u0092t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just \u0091ignore it and don\u0092t get upset by it\u0092! Even when I think about it now, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in utah, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the utah state specific resolution.", "Response": " In situations of harassment or discrimination based on sex, as described in the provided context, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits such behavior in any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The Utah State Board of Education (USBE) has designated Title IX coordinators with their contact information prominently posted in visible areas and on the school's website to ensure protections for students who are being discriminated based on their sex.\n\nIf the harassment occurred at a university or in a workplace, the first step would be to report the incident to the designated Title IX coordinator at that specific institution. The Title IX coordinator will provide information on the grievance process and direct the complainant to the appropriate authority for resolving the claim. If the matter cannot be resolved at the district/school level, assistance from the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) may be sought.\n\nThe Title IX training requirements in Utah state law also mandate that administrators receive training on the rights and prohibited acts under Title IX. This training ensures that all individuals involved understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a safe and nondiscriminatory learning environment.\n\nIn this case, the employee should report the incident to her manager or HR department, if it occurred at a workplace. If she is a student, she should follow the reporting procedures outlined by her institution. The USBE Title IX coordinator can provide further guidance on the grievance process and resources for students and employees experiencing harassment or discrimination based on sex."}, {"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"I left my job to return for a PhD with an intention of developing expertise in my field and preventing encounters with men who label me \u0093ignorant\u0094 or hint to my own incompetence. Part of my PhD requires public engagement via social media. In one such recent Twitter encounter, I stated my opinion and backed it up with facts. A man that disagreed then proceeded to lash out, calling my remarks \u0093effete\u0094 and \u0093ignorant.\u0094 I called out the blatant sexism, for which he continued to retaliate, calling my tone condescending.

If this instance of harassment occurred in a Utah educational institution or workplace, the following actions could be taken:\n1. Report the incident to the designated Title IX coordinator at your school or workplace. In Utah, all districts and charter schools are required to have a Title IX coordinator with contact information readily available. You can find this information on the school's website or by contacting the USBE Title IX Oversight.\n2. Provide as much detail as possible about the incident when reporting it, including dates, times, and any relevant evidence. The Title IX coordinator will assess the situation and determine appropriate action, which may include an investigation, mediation, or other remedies.\n3. If you feel unsafe or threatened, consider seeking support from additional resources such as law enforcement or the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights.\n4. Pursue training and resources provided by your school or workplace on Title IX policies and procedures, as well as awareness campaigns to promote a respectful and inclusive environment.\n5. Consider documenting any incidents of harassment or discrimination you experience, as this information may be useful in future investigations or legal proceedings.\n6. Speak up against sexism and other forms of discrimination when they occur, even if it is intimidating or uncomfortable. By doing so, you contribute to creating a safer and more inclusive environment for everyone.\n7. Remember that reporting incidents of harassment or discrimination does not guarantee an immediate resolution, but it is an essential step towards ensuring the protection of your rights under Title IX and fostering a culture of respect and equality in Utah schools and workplaces."}, {"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"As a 16 year old girl, I know very well that sexism exists. On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn\u0092t exist. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in utah, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

I just wanted to enjoy the game and had never experienced this He then got so close that his body was starting to press against mine.. I never looked back or said anything..I realised that something was horribly wrong and walked away from him, and out of the arcade hall\u0085 It was bright outside, the city bustling with people and I quickened my pace, looking behind me\u0085 I climbed onto a bus and thought that everyone around me knew, that they could see what had happened\u0085 I felt dirty, and disgusted\u0085 I understood then what girls were experiencing, the reality of what a lot of women deal with, the emotions that go through you when a stranger targets you for unwanted sexual contact\u0085 I am disgusted to see that twenty-five years on I still see the same attitudes from men, condoning this kind of behaviour\u0085I can walk down the street at night or any time of day without fearing sexual comments or assault, whereas all the accounts in this blog show that it is never the same for women\u0085 As an ethnically different man living in the UK (the incident in my teens happened in my home country) I get people in cars and vans shouting unintelligible things at me \u0096 always men \u0096 and that always makes me feel victimised, because although I cannot hear the words I can sense that they are meant to diminish me. I want to say this: sexual harassment and violence is not a \u0091women\u0092s issue\u0092, because men are responsible for it, therefore it is a men\u0092s issue, our issue. I want to try harder to change things, and I want to be brave (or I hope to be) and challenge sexism when I see it\u0085 I am horrified by what I read in this blog and I want to say this: we, men, can do better, so much better than this. I want to ask any man reading my post a question: have you ever had the urge to touch a female colleague, waitress, stranger (etc.) inappropriately, or to make suggestive remarks to her? If any man thinks that it is harmless, he should read this blog and realise the impact it has on women at the receiving end, how horrified, belittled, disgusted, and powerless it makes them feel\u0085 I hope more men will join me in stamping out harassment of this kind and taking a stand to make it a thing of the past. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in utah, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.
