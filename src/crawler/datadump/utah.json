Investigation: The first step would be for the educational institution or employer (given that California is a democratic state with a blue color code, it is assumed to be an educational institution or workplace subject to Title IX) to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident. This includes interviewing all parties involved and gathering any relevant documentation.\n\n2.

It started happening more and more and I asked him to stop and he would just laugh and continue. I was terrified of him and what my friends would think if they knew. I finally told my parents and they immediately told the head master of the school. I was so ready to have this issue resolved, but instead I was told that it was my fault. The administrators of my school said I was lying that he would never do that, and if he did do then I must have provoked it. I was humiliated.. 2 years later in my workplace it started again with a different guy. I began to wonder if maybe it was my fault. This time I was too scared to say anything fearful that it would be blamed on me yet again. When my boss found out he took the appropriate measures and fired the guy harassing me.

I am female and use the women\u0092s toilets. I am only attracted to men. I do not use make-up other than clear chap-stick to protect my lips because I see make up as a form of dishonesty to conceal one\u0092s true intentions (plus men don\u0092t have to wear it to be taken seriously so why should I!). Also make up containing muscovite mica often contains stone sourced from child labour in India. I do not want to support the exploitation of children in mica mines, hence I do not wear blusher or eyeshadow. I also wear trousers and don\u0092t go in for women\u0092s fashions.

Title IX applies to educational institutions, but some states, like Texas, have expanded its protections under their own laws.\n\nIn Texas, Section 51.285 of the Texas Education Code addresses a victim's request not to investigate an alleged incident of sexual harassment or assault. While your example does not involve physical contact, it may still qualify as sexual harassment under Title IX and similar state laws. In this situation, if you, the alleged victim, reported the inappropriate comments and requests for unwanted attention to your employer or supervisor and requested that they not investigate, the employer would need to consider several factors before making a decision.\n\nThese factors include:\n1. The seriousness of the alleged incident\n2. Whether there have been other reports of similar behavior from the perpetrator(s)\n3. Whether the alleged incident poses a risk of harm to others\n4.

In the scenario given, if a student is experiencing harassment of a sexual nature at a Utah K-12 public school or district, they have the right to report it to their Title IX coordinator or the USBE public hotline. The school or district is required to investigate and respond appropriately to such reports in a timely manner.\n\nIn the case described, if the student had reported the harassment to her school's administration, they should have taken her complaint seriously and initiated an investigation. They were obligated by law to provide a safe learning environment free from sex discrimination. If the administrators failed to take appropriate action and instead blamed the student, this would be a violation of Title IX.\n\nIn such cases, students can file a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The OCR will investigate the complaint and determine if there has been a violation of Title IX. If a violation is found, the school or district must take remedial action to resolve the situation and prevent future incidents from occurring.\n\nAdditionally, the student in this scenario was encouraged to report the harassment in her workplace as well. Employers are also required by law to have Title IX policies and procedures in place to address sexual harassment. If the employer failed to take appropriate action, the student may be able to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or a similar state agency.\n\nIt is important for students to know that they are not at fault for being subjected to harassment and that they have the right to report such incidents without fear of retaliation.

It shook my self-confidence at first, as I felt I must have brought it on myself, and it was only a while later that I realised that this guy was completely inappropriate.

They can contact Dr. Bonita Teasley, Executive Director, using the information provided in the example policy.\n\n2.
