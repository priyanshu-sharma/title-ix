Investigation: The first step would be for the educational institution or employer (given that California is a democratic state with a blue color code, it is assumed to be an educational institution or workplace subject to Title IX) to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident. This includes interviewing all parties involved and gathering any relevant documentation.\n\n2.

It started happening more and more and I asked him to stop and he would just laugh and continue. I was terrified of him and what my friends would think if they knew. I finally told my parents and they immediately told the head master of the school. I was so ready to have this issue resolved, but instead I was told that it was my fault. The administrators of my school said I was lying that he would never do that, and if he did do then I must have provoked it. I was humiliated.. 2 years later in my workplace it started again with a different guy. I began to wonder if maybe it was my fault. This time I was too scared to say anything fearful that it would be blamed on me yet again. When my boss found out he took the appropriate measures and fired the guy harassing me.

I am female and use the women\u0092s toilets. I am only attracted to men. I do not use make-up other than clear chap-stick to protect my lips because I see make up as a form of dishonesty to conceal one\u0092s true intentions (plus men don\u0092t have to wear it to be taken seriously so why should I!). Also make up containing muscovite mica often contains stone sourced from child labour in India. I do not want to support the exploitation of children in mica mines, hence I do not wear blusher or eyeshadow. I also wear trousers and don\u0092t go in for women\u0092s fashions.

I finally told my parents and they immediately told the head master of the school. I was so ready to have this issue resolved, but instead I was told that it was my fault. The administrators of my school said I was lying that he would never do that, and if he did do then I must have provoked it. I was humiliated.. 2 years later in my workplace it started again with a different guy. I began to wonder if maybe it was my fault. This time I was too scared to say anything fearful that it would be blamed on me yet again. When my boss found out he took the appropriate measures and fired the guy harassing me.

However, it is important to note that my response should not be considered legal advice. Instead, I will provide a general explanation of how Title IX may be relevant based on the provided context.\n\nTitle IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. In your example, it appears that the harassment took place in a workplace setting - specifically, at a clothes shop. Title IX applies to educational institutions, but some states, like Texas, have expanded its protections under their own laws.\n\nIn Texas, Section 51.285 of the Texas Education Code addresses a victim's request not to investigate an alleged incident of sexual harassment or assault. While your example does not involve physical contact, it may still qualify as sexual harassment under Title IX and similar state laws. In this situation, if you, the alleged victim, reported the inappropriate comments and requests for unwanted attention to your employer or supervisor and requested that they not investigate, the employer would need to consider several factors before making a decision.\n\nThese factors include:\n1. The seriousness of the alleged incident\n2. Whether there have been other reports of similar behavior from the perpetrator(s)\n3. Whether the alleged incident poses a risk of harm to others\n4. Any other relevant factors\n\nIf the employer decides not to investigate based on your request, they are required to take necessary steps to protect the health and safety of the workplace community. They must also inform you of their decision.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable reporting the incident directly or if the harassment continues despite reporting it, you may consider reaching out to an HR representative, equal employment opportunity (EEO) officer, or other designated personnel within your organization. Additionally, you can report the incident to state or local anti-discrimination agencies for further investigation and assistance.\n\nIt is important to remember that everyone deserves a safe and respectful work environment. If you are experiencing unwanted attention or inappropriate behavior at work, it is essential to speak up and take action to protect yourself and maintain the integrity of your workplace."}]
