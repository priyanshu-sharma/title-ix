First Reader  
Senate Bill 887  (Senator Lee)  
Education, Health, and  Environmental Affairs    
 
Primary and Secondary Education - Title IX - Policies and Procedures (Hear 
Our Voices Act of 2022)  
 
 
This bill requires, by March 31, 2023, the State Board of Education (SBE), after 
consultation with local school systems, to develop policies and procedures for reporting, 
administering, investigating, and resolving complaints related to incidents of sexual  
misconduct and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The Maryland State 
Department of Education (MSDE) must develop a database for administrators to upload 
sexual misconduct complaints. A public school must (1) notify the parent or guardian of a 
student who files a complaint; (2) collect data on sexual misconduct complaints and report 
the data to MSDE; and (3) inform students, faculty, and staff regarding who serves as the 
Title  IX coordinator for the school and how to file a sexual misconduct comp laint. A person 
may bring a civil action against a local school system that fails to comply with policies and 
procedures developed due to the bill and recover damages, reasonable costs, and attorney’s 
fees. SBE must adopt regulations to implement the bill.  The bill takes effect July  1, 2022.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary  
 
State Effect:   MSDE can develop the required database and regulations using existing 
resources. It is assumed that the Judiciary makes one -time program changes to the Judicial 
Information System using existing resources. It is assumed any increase in District  Court 
proce edings as a result of the bill can be handled with existing resources. Revenues are not 
affected.    
Local Effect:  Local school systems can notify the parent or guardian of a student who 
files a complaint related to sexual misconduct and collect the required data and report the 
data to MSDE annually using existing resources. Local school system legal expenditures 
may i ncrease; however, it is assumed that overall, the fiscal effect can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources. It is assumed any increase in circuit court proceedings as a 
result of the bill can be handled with existing resources.  
  
Small Business Effect:   None.  
  
     
SB 887 / Page 2 Analysis  
 
Current Law:  
 
Title IX  
 
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex  
in any federally funded education program or activity . The principal objective of Title  IX 
is to avoid the use of federal money to support sex discrimination in education programs 
and to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices. As entities 
that provide education and receive federal funds, local school systems must follow Title  IX 
requirements. Some key issue areas in which federal fund recipients have Title  IX 
obligations are  recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; 
sex-based harassment; treatment of pregnant and parenting stude nts; discipline; 
single -sex education; and employment.  The U.S. Department of Education’s (ED) Office 
for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX for recipients  that receive funds from ED. 
 
Title IX Regulations  
 
ED has announced its intention to release propo sed amendments to Title IX’s 
implementing regulations by April 2022. According to a statement, the new regulations 
will address (1) ensuring that schools are providing students with educational environments 
free from discrimination in the form of sexual ha rassment; (2) ensuring that schools have 
grievance procedures that provide for fair, prompt, and equitable resolution of reports of 
sexual harassment and other sex discrimination; and (3) addressing discrimination based 
on sex, including sexual orientation  and gender identity, in educational environments.  
 
These proposed regulations are intended to replace regulations that were proposed in 
November  2018 and became effective on August 14, 2020. Under the current federal 
regulations, legal experts report, a s chool system may dismiss sexual harassment, abuse, or 
assault complaints if the alleged perpetrator quits before or during an investigation, thus, 
allowing an alleged sex offender to move to another district without a paper trail. However, 
when the regulat ions were introduced, ED advised it would enforce the provisions on 
prohibition on aiding and abetting sexual abuse in the 2015 federal Every Student Succeeds 
Act, which prevent assisting an individual in obtaining a new job, apart from the routine 
transmi ssion of files, if the local school system knows or has probable cause to believe that 
the individual engaged in sexual misconduct regarding a minor or student. The current 
regulations also made other changes to the process, including increasing reporting 
requirements and changing the hearing process. Live hearings between student victims and 
the accused are optional under the current regulations.  
     
SB 887 / Page 3 Title IX Coordinator  
 
Under Title IX, each recipient must designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts 
to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under this part, including any investigation 
of any complaint communicated to such recipient alleging its noncom pliance with this part 
or alleging any actions that would be prohibited by this part. The recipient must  notify all 
of its students and employees of the name, office address , and telephone number of the 
employee or employees appointed . Further, a  recipient must  adopt and publish grievance 
procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee 
complaints alleging any action that would be prohibited by this part.  
 
In an April 25, 2015 “Dear Colleague” letter, ED stated that  the Title IX coordinator’s 
primary responsibility is to coordinate the recipient’s compliance with Title IX, including 
the recipient’s grievance procedures for resolving Title IX complaints. The Title IX 
coordinator is responsible for coordinating the rec ipient’s responses to all complaints 
involving possible sex discrimination.  Title IX does not specify who should determine the 
outcome of Title IX complaints or the actions the school will take in response to such 
complaints. The Title IX coordinator could  play this role, provided there are no conflicts 
of interest, but does not have to.  
 
Office of Civil Rights – Title IX (and Other) Complaints  
 
Any individual who believes that an education institution that receives federal financial 
assistance has discrimi nated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
sex, disability, or age  may file a complaint with the OCR. The person or organization filing 
the complaint does not have to be a victim of the alleged discrimination. A complaint must 
be filed within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. OCR does not handle cases that are 
being addressed by another agency or within a school’s formal grievance procedure if OCR 
anticipates the agency or school will provide a comparable resolution process. O nce that 
complaint process is complete, an individual has 60 days to file a complaint with OCR. 
OCR’s first step will be to determine whether to defer to the result reached in the other 
process.  
 
An OCR discrimination complaint may be filed by contacting t he local OCR enforcement 
office to obtain a form, or the online complaint form  may be used. In addition, an individual 
may write an email or a letter explaining the complaint to  the OCR enforcement office.

appropriate law enforcement agency. An “educator or human service worker” means any 
professional employee of any correctional, public, parochial, or private educational, health, 
juvenile service, social or social service agency, insti tution, or licensed facility. Such 
workers include any teacher, counselor, social worker, caseworker, and parole or probation 
officer. If the worker is acting as a staff member of a hospital, public health agency, 
child  care institution, juvenile detention  center, school, or similar institution, then the 
individual must notify the head of the institution or the designee. A “health practitioner” 
does not include an emergency medical dispatcher.  
 
A worker who notifies the appropriate authorities must make an oral report by telephone 
or direct communication as soon as possible to the local department or the appropriate law 
enforcement agency if the worker has reason to believe the child has been subjected to     
SB 887 / Page 5 abuse or neglect. A written report to the local depar tment is required not later than 48  hours 
after the contact, examination, or treatment that caused the worker to believe that the child 
had been subjected to abuse or neglect. A copy of the written report must be provided to 
the local State’s Attorney. An agency that receives an oral report of suspected abuse or 
neglect must immediately notify the other agency.  
 
As far as reasonably possible, a worker who makes a report must include the name, age, 
and home address of the child; the name and home address of the child’s parent or other 
person responsible for the child’s care; the whereabouts of the child; and the nature and 
extent of the child abuse or neglect. The report must include any available evidence about 
previous instances of abuse or neglect, any inf ormation that would help to determine the 
cause of the suspected abuse or neglect, and the identity of any person responsible for the 
abuse or neglect.  
 
In general, a person other than a health care practitioner, police officer, educator, or human 
service worker who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect 
must notify the local department of social services or the appropriate law enforcement 
agency. Such notification may be oral or in writing and must, to the extent possible , include 
the same information as specified above. Attorneys and clergy are generally exempt from 
reporting if they become aware of suspected abuse or neglect through privileged 
communications, as specified in statute.  
 
Individuals who in good faith make o r participate in making a report of abuse or neglect or 
participate in an investigation or resulting judicial proceeding are immune from civil 
liability or criminal penalties.  
 
State law does not criminalize the failure of a worker to report suspected abus e or neglect. 
The licensing boards for some workers who are mandated to report child abuse and neglect 
(nurses, doctors, and social workers are examples) are authorized to discipline workers for 
failing to report. Pursuant to Chapters 374 and 375 of 2016, if an agency is participating in 
a child abuse or neglect investigation and has substantial grounds to believe that a worker 
has knowingly failed to make a required report of suspected abuse or neglect, it must file a 
complaint with the worker’s licensing board, law enforcement agency, county board of 
education, or other agency, institution, or licensed facility, as appropriate, at which the 
worker is employed.

Main_ContentThe Intake Unit, which is a part of the Case Processing Department, is ready to assist you if you believe you are a victim of discrimination and wish to file a complaint. If you believe that you have been the victim of discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, or state contracts because of your race, color, religion or creed, sex, age, ancestry or national origin, marital status, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information (employment only), familial status (housing only), and/or ​source of income (housing only), you may file a complaint of discrimination with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights.
Complaints of employment ​must be filed within 300 days of the alleged unlawful incident, complaints of housing discrimination must be filed within one year of the alleged unlawful incident, and complaints of public accommodations discrimination must be filed within six (6) months of the alleged unlawful incident.
Note: Maryland employment anti-discrimination law applies only to those employers with 15 or more employees. However, complaints alleging unlawful employment harassment can be filed against employers with 1 or more employee.
If you believe you are a victim of unlawful discrimination, the first step to filing a complaint is to initiate an online inquiry using the form below. The completion of this online form does not constitute the filing of a complaint of discrimination with the Commission pursuant to Title 20 of the State Government Article, Annotate Code of Maryland. ​
After you complete this online form, the Intake Unit will contact you to schedule an interview (either by phone or in-person) with one of our trained Intake Officers to complete the process. You must complete the interview, and sign and return any and all necessary documents (including the Charge of Discrimination) to the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights before the complaint is officially filed.
