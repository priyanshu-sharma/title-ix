Sexual Harassment (Title IX)
It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person’s sex. Harassment can include sexual harassment or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment doesn't have to be of a sexual nature. It can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker or someone who isn't an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.

MENTOR CAPACITY BUILDING MINI-GRANT OPPORTUNITY  Mentor Kansas is a program of the Kansas Volunteer Commission, a program of the Kansas State Department of Education. For almost 16 years, we have worked to increase the capacity of mentoring programs to serve more youth and inspire more Kansans to be mentors. We connect mentoring programs, offer training and technical assistance, and provide funding opportunities and other resources that support program capacity.To support this purpose, Mentor Kansas announces the availability of grants to support youth mentoring initiatives that implement or enhance one or more of the Elements of Effective Practice for Mentoring (EEPM) and its supplements. The EEPM provides a set of evidence-based standards that ensure consistent, effective, and safe mentoring. The supplements to the EEPM expand on best practices to include diverse youth populations or industries that support youth leaders in areas of LGBTQ, E-mentoring, group, peer, STEM, workplace, critical mentoring, and youth with disabilities. Questions?

CIVIC ENGAGEMENTCivic Engagement is composed of individual and collective actions to identify and address issues of public concern. Civic engagement can take many forms, from individual volunteerism to organizational involvement to electoral participation. It can include efforts to directly address an issue, work with others in a community to solve a problem or interact with the institutions of representative democracy. Civic engagement encompasses a range of specific activities such as working in a soup kitchen, serving on a neighborhood association, writing a letter to an elected official, or voting. Indeed, an underlying principle  is that an engaged citizen should have the ability, agency, and opportunity to move comfortably among these various types of civic acts.Source: Michael Delli Carpini, Director, Public Policy, The Pew Charitable Trusts (apa.org)
MENTORINGMentoring is a consistent and stable relationship between youth and a caring role model(s) that involves regular, ideally face-to-face contact and is focused on building the character, capabilities, and confidence of the mentee(s). Mentoring can be formal
in the form of one-to-one, group, peer, community, school, faith-based, or mentoring that happens informally daily. Mentoring is one way for individuals to give youth another person who cares about them, who assures them they are not alone in dealing
with day-to-day challenges, and someone who makes them feel like they matter.Source: MentorKansas
NATIONAL SERVICEAmerica was founded on a promise of opportunity. When we build stronger communities, we help make this promise a reality for everyone to succeed. Especially in times of adversity, we find the courage to unite and overcome. We are supporting our communities, helping them prosper, head-on and together. It is what AmeriCorps is built for: bringing all Americans together—working alongside each other to improve every community—ensuring that everyone gets the help they need and the opportunities they deserve. AmeriCorps is your chance to be a part of something bigger. Source: AmeriCorps.gov
VOLUNTEERISMPeople the world over engage in volunteerism for a great variety of reasons: to help to eliminate poverty and to improve essential health and education, to tackle environmental issues, to reduce the risk of disasters, or to combat social exclusion
and violent conflict. In all these fields, volunteerism makes a specific contribution by generating well-being for people and their communities. Volunteers are motivated by values like justice, equality, and freedom. A society that supports and encourages different forms of volunteering is likely to be one that also promotes its citizens' well-being.Source: Unv.org/power-volunteerism

Sexual Harassment (Title IX)
It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person’s sex. Harassment can include sexual harassment or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment doesn't have to be of a sexual nature. It can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker or someone who isn't an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.

The EEOC invites the public to comment on its proposed “Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace”  through https://www.regulations.gov/document/EEOC-2023-0005-0001 until November 1.”
It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex. Harassment can include "sexual harassment" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person's sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn't prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 Is a federal statute that prohibits sex discrimination in any educational program or activity receiving federal funds.  Title IX states:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
All students (as well as other persons) at institutions /districts that receive federal funds are protected by Title IX – regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, race, or national origin – in all aspects of a recipient’s educational programs and activities (OCR Title IX Resource Guide).
Sexual Harassment and Discrimination on the basis of sex is not tolerated in the Kansas City, Kansas Public School.  For questions regarding our policy on sexual harassment and discrimination, please review Board policies AH/GAAC/JGEC and KN or contact our Title IX District Coordinator using the information located on this page.
In compliance with the United States Department of Education requirements, click on the links below to review Title IX Regulations Training Materials on Title IX Regulations.
Title IX regulations state a school or district has actual knowledge when notice of allegations of sexual harassment are reported to any school employee; or any employee personally observes such behavior. A school or district employee includes Title IX Coordinators, administrators, teachers, teacher’s aides, counselors, school resource officers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, maintenance staff workers, or any other employee.
Actual knowledge is met when any employee: Witnesses the conduct; Hears about the conduct from the alleged victim or anyone else (e.g., parent, friend, peer, anonymous reporter); or receives a written report of the conduct from the alleged victim or anyone else. Essentially, every employee is now a mandated reporter when actual knowledge of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct occurs. It’s everyone’s responsibility to stop, prevent, and remedy sexual harassment behaviors from continuing, once we become aware of this actual knowledge.
Report any Title IX or sexual harassment issues to your supervisor.  In most cases, your supervisor will be the building principal, department director or department manager.  To find out information regarding the identity of your department or school Title IX Coordinator, please contact your Department Director, Manager or school principal.
If the alleged harasser is one of these individuals, you can make the report to that individual’s supervisor or to the Human Resources department.  Additionally, you can also make a report directly to the District, Department, or School Title IX Coordinator.

2Report of Sexual Harassment
Actual 
KnowledgeTitle IX CoordinatorAny school official 
with authority to 
institute corrective 
measures on 
behalf of the 
district, or
(K-12 only) Any 
school employeeDistrict must respond 
when it has “actual knowledge” of sexual harassment.
Actual knowledge:
Notice of sexual 
harassment, including claims of sexual harassment
Other school employees 
report claims to Title IX Coordinator.
What is “actual knowledge?”
A male high school student tells his basketball coach his 
female high school math teacher has been sending him flirty SnapChats late at night, but he doesn’t have any proof.
Rumor has it that a parent is telling people in the community her daughter is being harassed by other students for being a lesbian.
An anonymous letter sent to your board members alleges your high school principal is sexually harassing a building paraprofessional and teacher.3
4Title IX 
Coordinator  
Contacts  
ComplainantResponse must not be “deliberately indifferent”
Clearly unreasonable in light of known 
circumstances
Promptly contact co mplainant, and meet 
confidentially:
1.To discuss availability of supportive measures,
2.Consider the complainant’s wishes with respect to supportive measures,
3.Inform the complainant of the availability of supportive measures with or without a formal complaint, and
4.Explain the process for filing a formal complaint.
KASB Policy Recommendation: 10 days, unless good cause for delay.
Should respect complain ant’s wishes regarding 
whether or not a school investigates, unless the Title IX Coordinator determines that signing a formal complaint over the wishes of the complainant is not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. 
So, when should the Title 
IX Coordinator  file in 
absence of a 
Complainant  willing to 
do so?
For liability purposes, it 
matters:
What do you know?
When did you know about it?
What did you do with that 
information?
Does anyone have a hypothetical, 
they are willing to share?5
6Formal 
ComplaintAt the time of filing a formal 
complaint, a comp lainant must be 
participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity of the District where the formal complaint is filed. 
A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, by email, or by any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the report.
A formal complaint contains the complainant’s physical or digital signature, or otherwise indicates that the complainant is the person filing the formal complaint (unless signed by the Title IX Coordinator). 
A complaint should be filed as soon as possible after the conduct occurs, but not later than 180 calendar days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation, unless the conduct forming the basis for the complaint is ongoing.
What if there is no 
formal complaint?
Supportive measures 
may be provided to both parties regardless
Document what happened
Close the file

The victim feels the behavior is sexual harassment; and
A reasonable person with the victim’s perspective would consider it to be sexual harassment as well.
There is no single test for distinguishing sexual harassment from merely offensive or inappropriate conduct.

6RETALIATION 
PROHIBITEDComplaints alleging retaliation may be filed according to the formal 
complaint investigation procedures for sex discrimination.
No district or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual fo r the purpose of interfering with 
any right or privilege secured by title IX or this part, or because the individual has made a report or co mplaint, testified, assisted, or 
participated or refused to pa rticipate in any manner in an 
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. 
Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for code of conduct violations that do not 
involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or formal complaint of sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by 
title IX or this part, constitutes retaliation. 
The district must keep confidential the identity of any individual who 
has made a report or complaint of sex discrimination, including any individual who has made a report or filed a formal complaint of

reported to be the perpetrator of sex discrimination, any respondent, and any witness, except as may be permitted by the FERPA, as required by law, or to conduct 
any investigation, hearing, or 
judicial proceeding arising thereunder. 
RETALIATION 
PROHIBITEDThe exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment 
does not constitute retaliation prohibited by Title IX. 
Charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a formal complaint investigation proceeding does not constitute retaliation, provided, however, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. 11

Scenario:  A Shy 
Source 
A male bus driver came to the Title 
IX Coordinator alleging that the female transportation director has been calling him pet names and finding times while he’s bent over checking tires and fluid levels to brush up against him or give him “atta boy” smacks on the hindquarters.
He is uncomfortable with this continuing, but he’s not willing to file a complaint if it means she will know he is the one who complained.
Can you keep his identity a secret during this process?

The licensee accepts all terms and conditions of this license and agrees to abide by all provisions. No other rights are provided, and all other rights are reserved. These materials are proprietary and are licensed to the licensee only, for their use. This license permits the licensee to use the materials personally and/or internally to the licensee’s organization for training purposes, only. If these materials are used to train Title IX personnel, they are subject to 34 CFR Part 106.45(b)(10), requiring all training materials to be publicly posted on a Recipient’s website. If you have lawfully obtained ATIXA materials by registering for an ATIXA training, you are licensed to use the materials provided for that training. Licensees may download and post a PDF version of training materials for their completed training to their organizational website to comply with federal regulations.
You are not authorized to copy or adapt these materials without explicit written permission from ATIXA. No one may remove this license language from any version of ATIXA materials.

We used an item not listed to create our forms, policies, and procedures; how do I post this?
You don’t. These are not trainings, or training materials and therefore not expected to post them. You do not have permission from ATIXA to post these copyrighted materials.
ATIXA determined that materials older than that would not address current regulations-based training requirements. Certifications older than two-years are no longer in good standing with ATIXA.
How quickly do I need to post the training materials once I take a training?
The regulations do not specify, they only state that all trainings must be posted, however recently OCR Investigations have shown the need to post the training materials on your website or provide a hard copy when asked.
I want to post the actual video recording (where applicable), how do I do this?
The regulations did not specify that recordings be posted, only training materials. Thus, ATIXA has provided training materials, and does not grant permission for the posting of any recordings at this time.
ATIXA has posted generic slide sets for the most part, as a training content does not vary substantially from training to training.
I want to list every training I have ever taken with ATIXA, can you provide this to me?
Training materials are only required to be posted for the time period starting August 14, 2020 and forward. There is no requirement to post trainings taken prior to this date. However, as there are people within their 2-year ATIXA Certification time-period, we have provided everything from 2018 to present. Your event transcript on your My ATIXA page will provide a list of all trainings.
You can post the slides provided on your ATIXA Event Lobby that was provided to you at the time of training.
