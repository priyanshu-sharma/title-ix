RE: T
itle IX Initiative and the District Entity & Information Management System 
O
n February 26, 2020, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 
announced a new Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) enforcement initiative to combat sexual assault in K–12 public schools. This initiative will also work to further implement and enforce the Every Student Succeeds Act’s (ESSA) directive that prohibits education agencies from assisting a school employee in obtaining a new job if the agency knows or has probable cause to believe the employee was engaged in sexual misconduct regarding a minor or student. The ESSA directive has exceptions, and all districts are advised to review the law at 20 U.S.C. § 7926. 
As
 part of the initiative, the OCR will condu ct compliance reviews, data quality reviews, and  
propose more data collection. The OCR also aim s to increase public awareness and support to 
address the issue of sexual assault in K–12 schools.  
P
lease ensure yo ur district’s Title IX Coordinator is a ware  of this  initiative.  To assist in T itle IX 
communications between districts and the South Carolina Department of Education (SCDE), districts are advised to ensure a Title IX Coordinator is named in the  SCDE’s  Dist rict & Entity 
Information M anagement system.  As noted in an OCR Dear Colleague letter from April 24, 
2015, the “Title IX Coordinator plays an essential role in helping you ensure that every person affected by the operations of your educational institution —including students, their parents or 
guardians, employee s, and applicants for admission and employment—is aware of the legal 
rights Title IX affords and that your institution and its officials comply with their legal obligations under Title IX.” Questions regarding Title IX, Title IX Coordinators, or this memo can be directed to Holly Hadden at hhadden@ed.sc.gov or 803-734-1807. SECTION  16-3-20. Punishment for murder; separate sentencing proceeding when death penalty sought.(A) A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years to life. If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C), and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, "life" or "life imprisonment" means until death of the offender without the possibility of parole, and when requested by the State or the defendant, the judge must charge the jury in his instructions that life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant without the possibility of parole. In cases where the defendant is eligible for parole, the judge must charge the applicable parole eligibility statute. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section. No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years to life pursuant to this section is eligible for parole or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years to life required by this section. Under no circumstances may a female who is pregnant be executed so long as she is pregnant or for a period of at least nine months after she is no longer pregnant. When the Governor commutes a sentence of death to life imprisonment under the provisions of Section 14, Article IV of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, the commutee is not eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, good conduct credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory imprisonment required by this subsection.(B) When the State seeks the death penalty, upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of murder, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding. In the proceeding, if a statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either death or life imprisonment. If no statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years to life. The proceeding must be conducted by the trial judge before the trial jury as soon as practicable after the lapse of twenty-four hours unless waived by the defendant. If trial by jury has been waived by the defendant and the State, or if the defendant pleaded guilty, the sentencing proceeding must be conducted before the judge. In the sentencing proceeding, the jury or judge shall hear additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the punishment. Only such evidence in aggravation as the State has informed the defendant in writing before the trial is admissible. This section must not be construed to authorize the introduction of any evidence secured in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the State of South Carolina or the applicable laws of either. The State, the defendant, and his counsel are permitted to present arguments for or against the sentence to be imposed. The defendant and his counsel shall have the closing argument regarding the sentence to be imposed.(C) The judge shall consider, or he shall include in his instructions to the jury for it to consider, mitigating circumstances otherwise authorized or allowed by law and the following statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances which may be supported by the evidence:(a) Statutory aggravating circumstances:(1) The murder was committed while in the commission of the following crimes or acts:(a) criminal sexual conduct in any degree;(b) kidnapping;(c) trafficking in persons;(d) burglary in any degree;(e) robbery while armed with a deadly weapon;(f) larceny with use of a deadly weapon;(g) killing by poison;(h) drug trafficking as defined in Section 44-53-370(e), 44-53-375(B), 44-53-440, or 44-53-445;(i) physical torture;(j) dismemberment of a person; or(k) arson in the first degree as defined in Section 16-11-110(A).(2) The murder was committed by a person with a prior conviction for murder.(3) The offender by his act of murder knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person in a public place by means of a weapon or device which normally would be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.(4) The offender committed the murder for himself or another for the purpose of receiving money or a thing of monetary value.(5) The murder of a judicial officer, former judicial officer, solicitor, former solicitor, or other officer of the court during or because of the exercise of his official duty.(6) The offender caused or directed another to commit murder or committed murder as an agent or employee of another person.(7) The murder of a federal, state, or local law enforcement officer or former federal, state, or local law enforcement officer, peace officer or former peace officer, corrections officer or former corrections officer, including a county or municipal corrections officer or a former county or municipal corrections officer, a county or municipal detention facility employee or former county or municipal detention facility employee, or fireman or former fireman during or because of the performance of his official duties.(8) The murder of a family member of an official listed in subitems (5) and (7) above with the intent to impede or retaliate against the official. "Family member" means a spouse, parent, brother, sister, child, or person to whom the official stands in the place of a parent or a person living in the official's household and related to him by blood or marriage.(9) Two or more persons were murdered by the defendant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.(10) The murder of a child eleven years of age or under.(11) The murder of a witness or potential witness committed at any time during the criminal process for the purpose of impeding or deterring prosecution of any crime.(12) The murder was committed by a person deemed a sexually violent predator pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 48, Title 44, or a person deemed a sexually violent predator who is released pursuant to Section 44-48-120.(b) Mitigating circumstances:(1) The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal conviction involving the use of violence against another person.(2) The murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance.(3) The victim was a participant in the defendant's conduct or consented to the act.(4) The defendant was an accomplice in the murder committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor.(5) The defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person.(6) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.(7) The age or mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime.(8) The defendant was provoked by the victim into committing the murder.(9) The defendant was below the age of eighteen at the time of the crime.(10) The defendant had mental retardation at the time of the crime. "Mental retardation" means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period.The statutory instructions as to statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be given in charge and in writing to the jury for its deliberation. The jury, if its verdict is a recommendation of death, shall designate in writing, and signed by all members of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances which it found beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury, if it does not recommend death, after finding a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, shall designate in writing, and signed by all members of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances it found beyond a reasonable doubt. In nonjury cases the judge shall make the designation of the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances. Unless at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances enumerated in this section is found, the death penalty must not be imposed.Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a recommendation of death is made, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to death. The trial judge, before imposing the death penalty, shall find as an affirmative fact that the death penalty was warranted under the evidence of the case and was not a result of prejudice, passion, or any other arbitrary factor. Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a sentence of death is not recommended by the jury, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in subsection (A). Before dismissing the jury, the trial judge shall question the jury as to whether or not it found a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. If the jury does not unanimously find any statutory aggravating circumstances or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, it shall not make a sentencing recommendation. Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is not found, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years. No person sentenced to life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years under this section is eligible for parole or to receive any work credits, good conduct credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the sentence required by this section. If the jury has found a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury shall designate this finding, in writing, signed by all the members of the jury. The jury shall not recommend the death penalty if the vote for such penalty is not unanimous as provided. If members of the jury after a reasonable deliberation cannot agree on a recommendation as to whether or not the death sentence should be imposed on a defendant found guilty of murder, the trial judge shall dismiss such jury and shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in subsection (A).(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14-7-1020, in cases involving capital punishment a person called as a juror must be examined by the attorney for the defense.(E) In a criminal action in which a defendant is charged with a crime which may be punishable by death, a person may not be disqualified, excused, or excluded from service as a juror by reason of his beliefs or attitudes against capital punishment unless such beliefs or attitudes would render him unable to return a verdict according to law.HISTORY: 1962 Code § 16-52; 1952 Code § 16-52; 1942 Code § 1102; 1932 Code § 1102; Cr.

If the court finds error prejudicial to the defendant in the sentencing proceeding conducted by the trial judge before the trial jury as outlined under Item (B) of Section 16-3-20, the court may set the sentence aside and remand the case for a resentencing proceeding to be conducted by the same or a different trial judge and by a new jury impaneled for such purpose.

SECTION  16-3-655. Criminal sexual conduct with a minor; aggravating and mitigating circumstances; penalties; repeat offenders.(A) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree if:(1) the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is less than eleven years of age; or(2) the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is less than sixteen years of age and the actor has previously been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or adjudicated delinquent for an offense listed in Section 23-3-430(C) or has been ordered to be included in the sex offender registry pursuant to Section 23-3-430(D).(B) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree if:(1) the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years of age; or(2) the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is at least fourteen years of age but who is less than sixteen years of age and the actor is in a position of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the victim to submit or is older than the victim. However, a person may not be convicted of a violation of the provisions of this item if he is eighteen years of age or less when he engages in consensual sexual conduct with another person who is at least fourteen years of age.(C) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the third degree if the actor is over fourteen years of age and the actor wilfully and lewdly commits or attempts to commit a lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body, or its parts, of a child under sixteen years of age, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of the actor or the child. However, a person may not be convicted of a violation of the provisions of this subsection if the person is eighteen years of age or less when the person engages in consensual lewd or lascivious conduct with another person who is at least fourteen years of age.(D)(1) A person convicted of a violation of subsection (A)(1) is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum of twenty-five years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, or must be imprisoned for life. In the case of a person pleading guilty or nolo contendere to a violation of subsection (A)(1), the judge must make a specific finding on the record regarding whether the type of conduct that constituted the sexual battery involved sexual or anal intercourse by a person or intrusion by an object. In the case of a person convicted at trial for a violation of subsection (A)(1), the judge or jury, whichever is applicable, must designate as part of the verdict whether the conduct that constituted the sexual battery involved sexual or anal intercourse by a person or intrusion by an object. If the person has previously been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or adjudicated delinquent for first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is less than eleven years of age or a federal or out-of-state offense that would constitute first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is less than eleven years of age, he must be punished by death or by imprisonment for life, as provided in this section. For the purpose of determining a prior conviction under this subsection, the person must have been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or adjudicated delinquent on a separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication, for first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is less than eleven years of age or a federal or out-of-state offense that would constitute first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is less than eleven years of age. In order to be eligible for the death penalty pursuant to this section, the sexual battery constituting the current offense and any prior offense must have involved sexual or anal intercourse by a person or intrusion by an object. If any prior offense that would make a person eligible for the death penalty pursuant to this section occurred prior to the effective date of this act and no specific finding was made regarding the nature of the conduct or is an out-of-state or federal conviction, the determination of whether the sexual battery constituting the prior offense involved sexual or anal intercourse by a person or intrusion by an object must be made in the separate sentencing proceeding provided in this section and proven beyond a reasonable doubt and designated in writing by the judge or jury, whichever is applicable. If the judge or jury, whichever is applicable, does not find that the prior offense involved sexual or anal intercourse by a person or intrusion by an object, then the person must be sentenced to imprisonment for life. For purposes of this subsection, imprisonment for life means imprisonment until death.(2) A person convicted of a violation of subsection (A)(2) is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for not less than ten years nor more than thirty years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted.(3) A person convicted of a violation of subsection (B) is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for not more than twenty years in the discretion of the court.(4) A person convicted of a violation of subsection (C) is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined in the discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or both.(E) If the State seeks the death penalty, upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant pursuant to this section, a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to items (1) and (2), and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, "life imprisonment" means until death of the offender without the possibility of parole, and when requested by the State or the defendant, the judge must charge the jury in his instructions that life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant without the possibility of parole. No person sentenced to life imprisonment, pursuant to this subsection, is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section. Under no circumstances may a female who is pregnant be executed, so long as she is pregnant or for a period of at least nine months after she is no longer pregnant. When the Governor commutes a sentence of death imposed pursuant to this section to life imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of Section 14, Article IV of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, the commutee is not eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, good conduct credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory imprisonment required by this subsection.(1) When the State seeks the death penalty, upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant pursuant to this section, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding. In the proceeding, if a statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either death or life imprisonment. The proceeding must be conducted by the trial judge before the trial jury as soon as practicable after the lapse of twenty-four hours unless waived by the defendant. If trial by jury has been waived by the defendant and the State, or if the defendant pled guilty, the sentencing proceeding must be conducted before the judge. In the sentencing proceeding, the jury or judge shall hear additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the punishment. Only evidence in aggravation as the State has informed the defendant in writing before the trial is admissible. This section must not be construed to authorize the introduction of any evidence secured in violation of the Constitution of the United States, or the State of South Carolina, or the applicable laws of either. The State, the defendant, and his counsel are permitted to present arguments for or against the sentence to be imposed. The defendant and his counsel shall have the closing argument regarding the sentence to be imposed.(2) In sentencing a person, upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant pursuant to this section, the judge shall consider, or he shall include in his instructions to the jury for it to consider, mitigating circumstances otherwise authorized or allowed by law and the following statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances which may be supported by the evidence:(a) Statutory aggravating circumstances:(i) The victim's resistance was overcome by force.(ii) The victim was prevented from resisting the act because the actor was armed with a dangerous weapon.(iii) The victim was prevented from resisting the act by threats of great and immediate bodily harm, accompanied by an apparent power to inflict bodily harm.(iv) The victim is prevented from resisting the act because the victim suffers from a physical or mental infirmity preventing his resistance.(v) The crime was committed by a person with a prior conviction for murder.(vi) The offender committed the crime for himself or another for the purpose of receiving money or a thing of monetary value.(vii) The offender caused or directed another to commit the crime or committed the crime as an agent or employee of another person.(viii) The crime was committed against two or more persons by the defendant by one act, or pursuant to one scheme, or course of conduct.(ix) The crime was committed during the commission of burglary in any degree, kidnapping, or trafficking in persons.(b) Mitigating circumstances:(i) The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal convictions involving the use of violence against another person.(ii) The crime was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance.(iii) The defendant was an accomplice in the crime committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor.(iv) The defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person.(v) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.(vi) The age or mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime.(vii) The defendant was below the age of eighteen at the time of the crime.The statutory instructions as to statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be given in charge and in writing to the jury for its deliberation. The jury, if its verdict is a recommendation of death, shall designate in writing, and signed by all members of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances, which it found beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury, if it does not recommend death, after finding a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, shall designate in writing, and signed by all members of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances it found beyond a reasonable doubt. In nonjury cases, the judge shall make the designation of the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances. Unless at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances enumerated in this section is found, the death penalty must not be imposed.When a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a recommendation of death is made, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to death. The trial judge, before imposing the death penalty, shall find as an affirmative fact that the death penalty was warranted under the evidence of the case and was not a result of prejudice, passion, or any other arbitrary factor. When a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a sentence of death is not recommended by the jury, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in this subsection. Before dismissing the jury, the trial judge shall question the jury as to whether or not it found a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. If the jury does not unanimously find any statutory aggravating circumstances or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, it shall not make a sentencing recommendation. When a statutory aggravating circumstance is not found, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole or to receive any work credits, good conduct credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the sentence required by this section. If the jury has found a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury shall designate this finding, in writing, signed by all the members of the jury. The jury shall not recommend the death penalty if the vote for the death penalty is not unanimous as provided. If members of the jury after a reasonable deliberation cannot agree on a recommendation as to whether or not the death sentence should be imposed on a defendant upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant pursuant to this section, the trial judge shall dismiss the jury and shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment, as provided in this subsection.(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14-7-1020, in cases involving capital punishment a person called as a juror must be examined by the attorney for the defense.(4) In a criminal action pursuant to this section, which may be punishable by death, a person may not be disqualified, excused, or excluded from service as a juror by reason of his beliefs or attitudes against capital punishment unless those beliefs or attitudes would render him unable to return a verdict according to law.(F)(1) In all cases in which an individual is sentenced to death pursuant to this section, the trial judge, before the dismissal of the jury, shall verbally instruct the jury concerning the discussion of its verdict. A standard written instruction must be promulgated by the Supreme Court for use in capital cases brought pursuant to this section.(2) The verbal instruction must include:(a) the right of the juror to refuse to discuss the verdict;(b) the right of the juror to discuss the verdict to the extent that the juror so chooses;(c) the right of the juror to terminate any discussion pertaining to the verdict at any time the juror so chooses;(d) the right of the juror to report any person who continues to pursue a discussion of the verdict or who continues to harass the juror after the juror has refused to discuss the verdict or communicated a desire to terminate discussion of the verdict; and(e) the name, address, and phone number of the person or persons to whom the juror should report any harassment concerning the refusal to discuss the verdict or the juror's decision to terminate discussion of the verdict.(3) In addition to the verbal instruction of the trial judge, each juror, upon dismissal from jury service, shall receive a copy of the written jury instruction as provided in item (1).(G)(1) Whenever the death penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, and upon the judgment becoming final in the trial court, the sentence shall be reviewed on the record by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. The clerk of the trial court, within ten days after receiving the transcript, shall transmit the entire record and transcript to the Supreme Court of South Carolina together with a notice prepared by the clerk and a report prepared by the trial judge. The notice shall set forth the title and docket number of the case, the name of the defendant and the name and address of his attorney, a narrative statement of the judgment, the offense, and the punishment prescribed. The report shall be in the form of a standard questionnaire prepared and supplied by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.(2) The Supreme Court of South Carolina shall consider the punishment as well as any errors by way of appeal.(3) With regard to the sentence, the court shall determine whether the:(a) sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor;(b) evidence supports the jury's or judge's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (E)(2)(a); and(c) sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.(4) Both the defendant and the State shall have the right to submit briefs within the time provided by the court and to present oral arguments to the court.(5) The court shall include in its decision a reference to those similar cases which it took into consideration. In addition to its authority regarding correction of errors, the court, with regard to review of death sentences, is authorized to:(a) affirm the sentence of death; or(b) set the sentence aside and remand the case for resentencing by the trial judge based on the record and argument of counsel. The records of those similar cases referred to by the Supreme Court of South Carolina in its decision, and the extracts prepared as provided for, must be provided to the resentencing judge for his consideration. If the court finds error prejudicial to the defendant in the sentencing proceeding conducted by the trial judge before the trial jury as outlined in subsection (E)(1), the court may set the sentence aside and remand the case for a resentencing proceeding to be conducted by the same or a different trial judge and by a new jury impaneled for this purpose. In the resentencing proceeding, the new jury, if the defendant does not waive the right of a trial jury for the resentencing proceeding, shall hear evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the punishment in addition to any evidence admitted in the defendant's first trial relating to guilt for the particular crime for which the defendant has been found guilty.(6) The sentence review is in addition to direct appeal, if taken, and the review and appeal must be consolidated for consideration. The court shall render its decision on all legal errors, the factual substantiation of the verdict, and the validity of the sentence.(H)(1) Whenever the solicitor seeks the death penalty pursuant to this section, he shall notify the defense attorney of his intention to seek the death penalty at least thirty days prior to the trial of the case. At the request of the defense attorney, the defense attorney must be excused from all other trial duties ten days prior to the term of court in which the trial is to be held.(2)(a) Whenever any person is charged with first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is less than eleven years and the death penalty is sought, the court, upon determining that the person is unable financially to retain adequate legal counsel, shall appoint two attorneys to defend the person in the trial of the action. One of the attorneys so appointed shall have at least five years' experience as a licensed attorney and at least three years' experience in the actual trial of felony cases, and only one of the attorneys so appointed may be the public defender or a member of his staff. In all cases when no conflict exists, the public defender or member of his staff must be appointed if qualified. If a conflict exists, the court then shall turn first to the contract public defender attorneys, if qualified, before turning to the Office of Indigent Defense.(b) Notwithstanding another provision of law, the court shall order payment of all fees and costs from funds available to the Office of Indigent Defense for the defense of the indigent. Any attorney appointed must be compensated at a rate not to exceed fifty dollars per hour for time expended out of court and seventy-five dollars per hour for time expended in court. Compensation may not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars and must be paid from funds available to the Office of Indigent Defense for the defense of indigent represented by court-appointed, private counsel.(3)(a) Upon a finding in ex parte proceedings that investigative, expert, or other services are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant, whether in connection with issues relating to guilt or sentence, the court shall authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtain services on behalf of the defendant and shall order the payment, from funds available to the Office of Indigent Defense, of fees and expenses not to exceed twenty thousand dollars as the court deems appropriate. Payment of these fees and expenses may be ordered in cases where the defendant is an indigent represented by either court-appointed, private counsel, or the public defender.(b) Court-appointed counsel seeking payment for fees and expenses shall request these payments from the Office of Indigent Defense within thirty days after the completion of the case. For the purposes of this statute, exhaustion of the funds shall occur if the funds administered by the Office of Indigent Defense and reserved for death penalty fees and expenses have been reduced to zero. If either the Death Penalty Trial Fund or the Conflict Fund has been exhausted in a month and the other fund contains money not scheduled to be disbursed in that month, then the Indigent Defense Commission must transfer a sufficient amount from the fund with the positive fund balance to the fund with no balance and pay the obligation to the extent possible.(4) Payment in excess of the hourly rates and limit in item (2) or (3) is authorized only if the court certifies, in a written order with specific findings of fact, that payment in excess of the rates is necessary to provide compensation adequate to ensure effective assistance of counsel and payment in excess of the limit is appropriate because the services provided were reasonably and necessarily incurred. Upon a finding that timely procurement of services cannot await prior authorization, the court may authorize the provision of and payment for services nunc pro tunc.(5) After completion of the trial, the court shall conduct a hearing to review and validate the fees, costs, and other expenditures on behalf of the defendant.(6) The Supreme Court shall promulgate guidelines on the expertise and qualifications necessary for attorneys to be certified as competent to handle death penalty cases brought pursuant to this section.(7) The Office of Indigent Defense shall maintain a list of death penalty qualified attorneys who have applied for and received certification by the Supreme Court as provided for in this subsection. In the event the court-appointed counsel notifies the chief administrative judge in writing that he or she does not wish to provide representation in a death penalty case, the chief administrative judge shall advise the Office of Indigent Defense which shall forward a name or names to the chief administrative judge for consideration. The appointment power is vested in the chief administrative judge. The Office of Indigent Defense shall establish guidelines as are necessary to ensure that attorneys' names are presented to the judges on a fair and equitable basis, taking into account geography and previous assignments from the list. Efforts must be made to present an attorney from the area or region where the action is initiated.(8) The payment schedule provided in this subsection, as amended by Act 164 of 1993, shall apply to any case for which trial occurs on or after July 1, 1993.(9) Notwithstanding another provision of law, only attorneys who are licensed to practice in this State and residents of this State may be appointed by the court and compensated with funds appropriated to the Death Penalty Trial Fund in the Office of Indigent Defense. This item shall not pertain to any case in which counsel has been appointed on the effective date of this act.(10) The judicial department biennially shall develop and make available to the public a list of standard fees and expenses associated with the defense of an indigent person in a death penalty case.(I) Notwithstanding another provision of law, in any trial pursuant to this section when the maximum penalty is death or in a separate sentencing proceeding following the trial, the defendant and his counsel shall have the right to make the last argument.HISTORY: 1977 Act No. 157 § 5; 1978 Act No. 639 § 1; 1984 Act No. 509; 2005 Act No. 94, § 1, eff June 1, 2005; 2006 Act No. 342, § 3, eff July 1, 2006; 2006 Act No. 346, § 1, eff July 1, 2006; 2008 Act No. 335, § 18, eff June 16, 2008; 2010 Act No. 289, § 6, eff June 11, 2010; 2012 Act No. 255, § 1, eff June 18, 2012.

SECTION  16-3-740. Testing of certain convicted offenders for Hepatitis B and HIV.(A) For purposes of this section:(1) "Body fluid" means blood, amniotic fluid, pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, semen or vaginal secretions, or any body fluid visibly contaminated with blood.(2) "HIV" means the Human Immunodeficiency Virus.(3) "Offender" includes adults and juveniles.(B) Upon the request of a person who is the victim of a criminal offense which involves the sexual penetration of the victim's body or who has been exposed to body fluids during the commission of a criminal offense, or upon the request of the legal guardian of a person who is the victim of a criminal offense which involves the sexual penetration of the victim's body or who has been exposed to body fluids during the commission of a criminal offense, the solicitor, after the offender is charged, must petition the court for an order to have the offender tested for Hepatitis B and HIV. An offender must be tested pursuant to this section for Hepatitis B and HIV as soon as practicable after the court order is issued but not later than forty-eight hours after the date the person is indicted for the offense or waives indictment for the offense. If the offender is subject to the jurisdiction of the family court, he must be tested not later than forty-eight hours after the petition is filed with the family court alleging he is delinquent for committing the offense. If the offender cannot be located before the end of the forty-eight hour period as provided in this subsection, the forty-eight hour period is tolled until the offender is located by law enforcement. To obtain a court order, the solicitor must demonstrate the following, that the:(1) victim or the victim's legal guardian requested the tests;(2) offender has been charged with, indicted for, or waived indictment for an offense which involved the sexual penetration of the victim's body or that there is probable cause that during the commission of the criminal offense there was a risk that body fluids were transmitted from one person to another; and(3) offender has received notice of the petition and notice of his right to have counsel represent him at a hearing.The results of the tests must be kept confidential but disclosed to the solicitor who obtained the court order. As soon as practicable, the solicitor shall notify only those persons designated in subsection (C) of the results of the initial Hepatitis B and HIV tests and the results of any follow-up HIV tests.(C) The tests must be administered by the Department of Health and Environmental Control through the local county health department or the medical professional at the state or local detention facility where the offender is imprisoned or detained. The solicitor shall notify the following persons of the tests results:(1) the victim or the legal guardian of a victim who is a minor or is a person with intellectual disability or mentally incapacitated;(2) the victim's attorney;(3) the offender and a juvenile offender's parent or guardian; and(4) the offender's attorney.The results of the tests shall be provided to the designated recipients with the following disclaimer: "The tests were conducted in a medically approved manner, but tests cannot determine infection by Hepatitis B or HIV with absolute accuracy. Additionally, the testing does not determine exposure to, or infection by, other sexually transmitted diseases. Persons receiving the test results should continue to monitor their own health, seek retesting in approximately six months, and should consult a physician as appropriate".The solicitor also shall provide to the state or local correctional facility where the offender is imprisoned or detained and the Department of Health and Environmental Control the test results for HIV and Hepatitis B which indicate that the offender is infected with the disease. The state or local correctional facility where the offender is imprisoned or detained shall use this information solely for the purpose of providing medical treatment to the offender while the offender is imprisoned or detained. The State shall pay for the tests. If the offender is subsequently convicted or adjudicated delinquent, the offender or the parents of an adjudicated offender must reimburse the State for the costs of the tests unless the offender or the parents of the adjudicated offender are determined to be indigent.If the tests given pursuant to this section indicate infection by Hepatitis B or HIV, the Department of Health and Environmental Control shall be provided with all test results and must provide counseling to the offender regarding the disease, syndrome, or virus. The Department of Health and Environmental Control must provide counseling for the victim, advise the victim of available medical treatment options, refer the victim to appropriate health care and support services, and, at the request of the victim or the legal guardian of a victim, test the victim for HIV and Hepatitis B and provide post-testing counseling to the victim.(D) If deemed medically appropriate, the offender must undergo follow-up testing for HIV. The follow-up testing, and any counseling which may be ordered, shall be performed on dates that occur six weeks, three months, and six months following the initial test. Any follow-up testing shall be terminated if the offender obtains an acquittal on, dismissal of, or is not adjudicated delinquent for all charges for which testing was ordered.(E) If, for any reason, the testing requested under subsection (B) has not been undertaken, upon request of the victim or the victim's legal guardian, the court shall order the offender to undergo testing for Hepatitis B and HIV following conviction or delinquency adjudication.

Monies seized must be deposited in an interest bearing account pending final disposition by the court unless the seizing agency determines the monies to be of an evidential nature and provides for security in another manner.(7) When property and monies of any value as defined in this article or anything else of any value is seized, the law enforcement agency making the seizure, within ten days or a reasonable period of time after the seizure, shall submit a report to the appropriate prosecution agency.(a) The report must provide the following information with respect to the property seized:(i) description;(ii) circumstances of seizure;(iii) present custodian and where the property is being stored or its location;(iv) name of owner;(v) name of lienholder; and(vi) seizing agency.(b) If the property is a conveyance, the report shall include the:(i) make, model, serial number, and year of the conveyance;(ii) person in whose name the conveyance is registered; and(iii) name of any lienholders.(c) In addition to the report, the law enforcement agency shall prepare for dissemination to the public upon request a report providing the following information:(i) a description of the quantity and nature of the property and money seized;(ii) the seizing agency;(iii) the make, model, and year of a conveyance; and(iv) the law enforcement agency responsible for the property or conveyance seized.(d) Property or conveyances seized by a law enforcement agency or department may not be used by officers for personal purposes.(B)(1) Forfeiture of property must be accomplished by petition of the Attorney General or his designee or the circuit solicitor or his designee to the court of common pleas for the jurisdiction where the items were seized. The petition must be submitted to the court within a reasonable time period following seizure and shall provide the facts upon which the seizure was made. The petition shall describe the property and include the names of all owners of record and lienholders of record. The petition shall identify any other persons known to the petitioner to have interests in the property. Petitions for the forfeiture of conveyances also shall include the make, model, and year of the conveyance, the person in whose name the conveyance is registered, and the person who holds the title to the conveyance. A copy of the petition must be sent to each law enforcement agency which has notified the petitioner of its involvement in effecting the seizure. Notice of hearing or rule to show cause must be directed to all persons with interests in the property listed in the petition, including law enforcement agencies which have notified the petitioner of their involvement in effecting the seizure. Owners of record and lienholders of record may be served by certified mail, to the last known address as appears in the records of the governmental agency which records the title or lien.(2) The judge shall determine whether the property is subject to forfeiture and order the forfeiture confirmed. The Attorney General or his designee or the circuit solicitor or his designee has the burden of proof to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the judge finds a forfeiture, he shall then determine the lienholder's interest as provided in this article. The judge shall determine whether any property must be returned to a law enforcement agency pursuant to this section.(3) If there is a dispute as to the division of the proceeds of forfeited property among participating law enforcement agencies, this issue must be determined by the judge. The proceeds from a sale of property, conveyances, and equipment must be disposed of pursuant to this section.(4) All property, conveyances, and equipment which will not be reduced to proceeds may be transferred to the law enforcement agency or agencies or to the prosecution agency. Upon agreement of the law enforcement agency or agencies and the prosecution agency, conveyances and equipment may be transferred to any other appropriate agency. Property transferred may not be used to supplant operating funds within the current or future budgets. If the property seized and forfeited is an aircraft or watercraft and is transferred to a state law enforcement agency or other state agency pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, its use and retainage by that agency is at the discretion and approval of the Department of Administration.(5) If a defendant or his attorney sends written notice to the petitioner or the seizing agency of his interest in the subject property, service may be made by mailing a copy of the petition to the address provided, and service may not be made by publication. In addition, service by publication may not be used for a person incarcerated in a Department of Corrections facility, a county detention facility, or other facility where inmates are housed for the county where the seizing agency is located. The seizing agency shall check the appropriate institutions after receiving an affidavit of nonservice before attempting service by publication.(6) Any forfeiture may be effected by consent order approved by the court without filing or serving pleadings or notices provided that all owners and other persons with interests in the property, including participating law enforcement agencies, entitled to notice under this section, except lienholders and agencies, consent to the forfeiture. Disposition of the property may be accomplished by consent of the petitioner and those agencies involved. Persons entitled to notice under this section may consent to some issues and have the judge determine the remaining issues.(7) Disposition of forfeited property under this section must be accomplished as follows:(a) Property forfeited under this subsection shall first be applied to payment to the victim. The return of the victim to his home country or other absence of the victim from the jurisdiction shall not prevent the victim from receiving compensation.(b) The victim and the South Carolina Victim Compensation Fund shall each receive one-fourth, and law enforcement shall receive one-half of the value of the forfeited property.(c) If no victim is named, or reasonable attempts to locate a named victim for forfeiture and forfeiture fails, then all funds shall revert to the South Carolina Victim Compensation Fund and law enforcement to be divided equally.(d) If federal law enforcement becomes involved in the investigation, they shall equitably split the share local law enforcement receives under this section, if they request or pursue any of the forfeiture. The equitable split must be pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Section 881(e)(1)(A) and (e)(3), 18 U.S.C. Section 981(e)(2), and 19 U.S.C. Section 1616a.(C)(1) An innocent owner, manager, or owner of a licensed rental agency or any common carrier or carrier of goods for hire may apply to the court of common pleas for the return of any item seized. Notice of hearing or rule to show cause accompanied by copy of the application must be directed to all persons and agencies entitled to notice. If the judge denies the application, the hearing may proceed as a forfeiture hearing.(2) The court may return any seized item to the owner if the owner demonstrates to the court by a preponderance of the evidence:(a) in the case of an innocent owner, that the person or entity was not a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture; or(b) in the case of a manager or an owner of a licensed rental agency, a common carrier, or a carrier of goods for hire, that any agent, servant, or employee of the rental agency or of the common carrier or carrier of goods for hire was not a party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.If the licensed rental agency demonstrates to the court that it has rented the seized property in the ordinary course of its business and that the tenant or tenants were not related within the third degree of kinship to the manager or owner, or any agents, servants, or employees of the rental agency, then it is presumed that the licensed rental agency was not a party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.(3) The lien of an innocent person or other legal entity, recorded in public records, shall continue in force upon transfer of title of any forfeited item, and any transfer of title is subject to the lien, if the lienholder demonstrates to the court by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the involvement of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.(D) A person who uses property or a conveyance in a manner which would make the property or conveyance subject to forfeiture except for innocent owners, rental agencies, lienholders, and the like as provided for in this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for not less than thirty days nor more than one year, fined not more than five thousand dollars, or both. The penalties prescribed in this section are cumulative and must be construed to be in addition to any other penalty prescribed by another provision of this article.HISTORY: 2012 Act No. 258, § 1, eff December 15, 2012.

The department shall provide assistance as needed to complete the application and shall ensure that all applicants or recipients have or promptly apply for and obtain a Social Security number. No assistance may be granted to Family Independence applicants or recipients until a valid Social Security number has been provided to the department for each member of the family for whom aid is sought or when numbers are not available until there is proof that application for the Social Security number has been made. The department shall assist the applicant or recipient in obtaining a Social Security number through procedures adopted in cooperation with the Social Security Administration or the applicant or recipient may apply for a Social Security number at the Social Security Administration office. For purposes of state-funded or Title IV-E Foster Care, the application for the Social Security number must be made by the state or local department. The application for eligibility also shall provide that, as a condition of eligibility for aid, each applicant or recipient shall:(1) Assign to the State any rights to support from any other person the applicant may have in his own behalf or in behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid and which have accrued at the time the assignment is executed or which may accrue in the future; however, by accepting public assistance for or on behalf of a child or children, or by making application for services under Title IV-D or through placement of a child or children in state-funded foster care or under Title IV-E, except where good cause as determined by the department exists, the recipient or applicant is considered to have made an assignment to the State Department of Social Services of any rights, title, and interest to any support obligation which is owed for the child or children or for the absent parent's spouse or former spouse who is the recipient or the applicant with whom the child is living, if and to the extent that a spousal support obligation has been established and the child support obligation is being enforced pursuant to Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act. The assignment to the department is considered to have been made up to the amount of public assistance money or foster care board payments paid for or on behalf of the child or children for that period of time as the public assistance monies or foster care board payments are paid. The assignment consists of all rights and interest in any support obligation that the recipient may be owed past, present, or future by any person up to the amount of public assistance money paid to the recipient for or on behalf of the minor child or children or a child in foster care. The department is subrogated to the rights of the child or children or the person having custody of the child or children to collect and receive all support payments. The department has the right to initiate a support action in its own name or in the name of the recipient to recover payments ordered by the courts of this or any other state or to obtain a court order to initiate these payments including an action to determine the paternity of a child.(2) Cooperate with the State in establishing the paternity of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom aid is claimed and in obtaining support payments for the applicant and for a child with respect to whom the aid is claimed or in obtaining any other payments or property due the applicant of the child and that, if the relative with whom a child is living is found to be ineligible because of failure to comply with the requirements of items (1) and (2), aid for which the child is eligible must be provided in the form of protective payments. The department shall establish criteria in accordance with federal regulations to determine whether action to establish paternity and secure support is not in the best interest of a child.(b) The term "protective payments" shall mean payments with respect to any dependent child which are made to another individual who, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the department, is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such child or relative, or are made on behalf of such child or relative directly to a person furnishing food, living accommodations, or other goods, services, or items to or for such child.(c) Prior to determinations of eligibility, the department shall conduct a personal interview with the adult members of the family or with the caretaker relatives of the needy children.(d) The department shall redetermine all elements of eligibility periodically but not less frequently than every twelve months. The department may require the family to complete a new application at the time of each redetermination.(e) If the application is mailed to the family, it must be accompanied by an addressed envelope for its return. In no event may the acts of mailing to the recipient or the recipient's return of a completed application to the department be substituted in lieu of a personal interview.(f) Each adult member of the family shall provide, under penalty of perjury the information necessary to complete the application. The applications used by the department shall contain a statement that the applicant or recipient understands that he has an obligation to report immediately to the department any changes of address, household composition, employment, loss of employment, or any other factor which may affect eligibility and that the declarations in the application are correct and complete to the best of the applicant's or recipient's knowledge or belief and are made under penalty of perjury. The statement shall clearly specify that failure to report changes in circumstances that may affect eligibility and grant amount within ten calendar days of the day on which the change becomes known to the recipient constitutes withholding of information and permits the department to recover any overpayment occasioned or caused by the withholding in accordance with Section 43-5-30. This application must be signed by the applicant or recipient of assistance or any person completing the application for an applicant or recipient unable to do so himself.The person completing the application for an applicant or recipient unable to do so himself must sign a statement attesting to the fact that this section has been explained to the applicant and to the belief that the applicant understands.HISTORY: 1978 Act No. 549; 1979 Act No. 76 §§ 2, 3; 1982 Act No. 460, § 1; 1985 Act No. 70, eff May 2, 1985; 1986 Act No. 323, § 2, eff February 20, 1986; 1995 Act No. 102, Part VI, § 4, approved June 12, 1995 and takes effect ninety days after receipt of approval of a federal waiver authorizing the department to implement these provisions or ninety days after federal law permits implementation; 1997 Act No. 133, § 7, eff June 11, 1997.

No person shall be eligible for aid to families with dependent children unless he is a resident of the State.If a recipient is or will be absent from the State for a period of thirty days or longer, the department shall consider the recipient ineligible for assistance.It is not the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this section to create any durational residence requirement.HISTORY: 1978 Act No. 549; 1979 Act No. 76 § 4; 1997 Act No. 133, § 7, eff June 11, 1997.

SECTION  43-5-125. "Living with" defined; verification of child's residence.The term "living with" means that the caretaker relative and the child maintain a common place of residence. The requirement shall be considered met if a home and family setting is maintained or is being established and the caretaker relative exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child even though the child or caretaker is temporarily absent from time to time. A child is considered to be "living with" the caretaker relative even though he is under the jurisdiction of the court or is in the legal custody of an agency that does not have physical possession of the child.Temporary absences by either the caretaker relative or the child from the home for purposes such as vacationing, visiting, hospitalization, convalescing, and school attendance shall not constitute a break in the "living with" requirement. The temporary absence may not exceed thirty days; however, the department may extend the absence, in extenuating circumstances, for up to an additional sixty days if it is determined that a longer absence would serve the best interests of the family.HISTORY: 1978 Act No. 549; 1979 Act No. 76 § 7; 1997 Act No. 133, § 7, eff June 11, 1997.
SECTION  43-5-130.

However, the applicant or recipient shall, as a necessary condition of determining eligibility:(1) provide all information necessary to income determination;(2) take all actions necessary to obtain unconditionally available income. Income shall be considered unconditionally available if the applicant or recipient has only to claim or accept such income, including any type of governmental benefits, social insurance, and private pension or benefits plan.(d) The department shall require evidence which establishes the gross and net amount of income received and the time and frequency of receipt. Documents and records in the possession of the applicant or recipient together with a written statement made under penalty of perjury that such information is correct and complete to the best of the applicant or recipient's knowledge or belief constitute adequate sources of evidence in absence of conflicts. Such documents or records shall be returned promptly to the applicant or recipient after necessary copies have been made and placed in the case records.HISTORY: 1978 Act No. 549; 1979 Act No. 76 §§ 8, 9; 1997 Act No. 133, § 7, eff June 11, 1997.

Such facts may include, but are not limited to, composition of household, address or any other factor which may affect eligibility, or failure or refusal to obtain unconditionally available income. If appropriate, recoupment proceedings may be initiated.(d) When the department receives information that would result in a change in grant amount or eligibility, the department shall take action to adjust the grant or redetermine eligibility, consistent with notice requirements, within ten days of receipt of such information.HISTORY: 1978 Act No. 549; 1979 Act No. 76 §§ 10, 11; 1997 Act No. 133, § 7, eff June 11, 1997.

The debt for past-due support must be at least sixty days in arrears and is in excess of twenty-five dollars as provided in Section 12-7-2240. At the time of the submission, the department shall notify the debtor that his state tax refund will be subject to a debt for past-due support. The notice shall set forth the name of the debtor, the amount of the claimed debt, the intention to set off the refund against the debt, the taxpayer's opportunity to give written notice to contest the set off within thirty days of the date of mailing of the notice, the appropriate office of the department to which the application for a hearing must be sent, and the fact that failure to apply for a hearing in writing within the thirty-day period will be considered a waiver of the opportunity to contest the set off. If the debtor makes written application to contest the set off within thirty days of notification, the department shall provide an opportunity for a hearing and is responsible for refunding any monies wrongfully collected. If no application is made, the debtor's refund must be used to set off the amount owed.

SECTION  43-5-590. Powers and duties of Department of Social Services in accordance with approved child support plan.In accordance with a child support plan approved by the federal government, the department has the power and its duty must be to:(a) require as a condition of eligibility for assistance that the applicant or recipient:(i) furnish his social security account number or, to the extent permitted by federal law, proof of making application for a social security account number if the applicant or recipient has no social security account number;(ii) assign to the State the rights to support, including health care expenses, from any other person the applicant may have in his own behalf or in behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid and which have accrued at the time the assignment is executed or which may accrue in the future. By accepting public assistance for or on behalf of a child or children, by making application for services under Title IV-D, or through placement of a child or children in state-funded foster care or under Title IV-E, except where good cause as determined by the agency exists, the recipient or applicant is considered to have made an assignment to the State Department of Social Services of rights, title, and interest to a support obligation which is owed for the child or children or for the absent parent's spouse or former spouse who is the recipient or the applicant with whom the child is living, if and to the extent that a spousal support obligation has been established and the child and the child support obligation is being enforced pursuant to Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act. The assignment to the department is considered to have been made up to the amount of public assistance money, including Medicaid payments, or foster care board payments paid for or on behalf of the child or children for that period of time as the public assistance monies or foster care board payments are paid. The assignment consists of all rights and interest in a support obligation that the recipient may be owed past, present, or future by a person up to the amount of public assistance money, including Medicaid payments, paid to the recipient for or on behalf of the minor child or children or a child in foster care. The department is subrogated to the rights of the child or children or the person having custody of the child or children to collect and receive all support payments. The department has the right to initiate a support action in its own name or in the name of the recipient to recover payments ordered by the courts of this or any other state or to obtain a court order to initiate these payments including an action to determine the paternity of a child. The clerk of court shall execute the necessary order substituting the department and changing the payee of the support to the department upon receipt by the clerk of the notice of assignment.(iii) cooperate with the department in establishing the paternity of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom aid is claimed, and in obtaining support payments for such applicant and for a child with respect to whom such aid is claimed, or in obtaining any other payments or property due such applicant of such child and that, if the relative with whom a child is living is found to be ineligible because of failure to comply with the requirements of items (a) and (b), any aid for which such child is eligible will be provided in the form of protective payments. The department shall establish criteria in accordance with federal regulations to determine whether action to establish paternity and secure support is not in the best interest of a child.(b) Provide for protective payments for any child eligible for assistance when a caretaker relative is ineligible due to the caretaker relative's failure to comply with either subitems (1) or (2) of item (a) of this section.(c) Provide that in any case in which the child support payments are collected for a child with respect to whom an assignment has been made pursuant to subitem (ii) of item (a) of this section the payment is made to the department for distribution pursuant to item (g) of this section except for those payments made for any month in which the amount collected is sufficient to make the family ineligible for assistance. The department shall pay the amounts to the recipient consistent with federal laws and regulations. Whenever a family ceases receiving public assistance the assignment pursuant to subitem (ii) of item (a) of this section converts to a nonpublic assistance assignment. However, the nonpublic assistance recipient may submit a written request to have the assignment terminated except with respect to the amount of any unpaid support obligation that has accrued under the assignment. From this amount the department shall attempt to collect the unpaid obligation and distribute the amounts consistent with federal laws and regulations. The department may not charge fees or recover costs from support collections and shall pay all amounts collected which represent monthly support payment and arrearage owed to the family. The department shall continue to provide all appropriate IV-D services and distribute any amounts collected consistent with federal laws and regulations except that the department may not require any formal application or impose an application fee but may recover costs consistent with federal laws and regulations pursuant to item (f) of this section.(d) The department shall create a single and separate organizational unit which is responsible for developing and implementing a federally-approved state plan for child support. The unit shall maintain a parent locator service to locate absent relatives owing or allegedly owing child support, utilizing all sources of information and legally available records and the parent locator service of the federal Department of Health and Human Services by filing in accordance with Section 453(B) of the Social Security Act.(e) Undertake either directly or pursuant to cooperative arrangements with appropriate courts or law enforcement officials to:(i) establish paternity of children born out of wedlock with respect to whom an assignment pursuant to subitem (2) of item (a) of this section has been made or with respect to an individual not otherwise eligible pursuant to item (f) of this section;(ii) secure support for a child with respect to whom such an assignment has been made from any legally responsible relative.(f) The department shall provide that the support collection or paternity determination services made available to approved applicants for the Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program under this section be made available to an individual not receiving assistance under the program who files an application for the services with the department. For an individual not otherwise eligible for these services under the program, a fee and cost may be imposed by the department. The fee and cost must be an amount not to exceed the amount permitted by federal law. The fees and cost recoveries as would cause a reduction in the amount of federal matching funds must be retained by the department to offset, dollar for dollar, the federal reductions. When there is an assignment of the rights to support, the clerk of court shall execute the necessary order substituting the department and changing the payee of the support to the department upon receipt by the clerk of the notice of assignment.(g) provide for bonus payments to recipients consistent with federal law from amounts collected periodically without any decrease in the amount of assistance;(h) make incentive payments to political subdivisions consistent with federal law whenever the political subdivision enforces or collects support rights assigned to the department pursuant to subitem (2) of item (a) and item (f) of this section.(i) construe and implement this section in order to comply with Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act relating to child support and the establishment of paternity. The department shall take all steps necessary to implement a federally approved state plan for child support.(j) to provide that in rendering services under the plan to individuals with respect to whom an assignment is effective under this section, the State represents the public interest in establishing and enforcing child support obligations and the assignment does not create an attorney-client relationship between the agency and the custodial parent, the child, or any other party.HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 511, § 1, eff July 1, 1986; 1989 Act No. 195, § 6, eff June 19, 1989; 1990 Act No. 336, §§ 1, 2, eff February 20, 1990; 1990 Act No. 493, § 1, eff May 29, 1990; 1990 Act No. 576, § 1, eff June 11, 1990; 1992 Act No. 297, § 1, eff March 26, 1992; 1995 Act No. 102, Part VI, § 3, eff January 1, 1996; 1997 Act No. 71, § 43, eff June 10, 1997.

SECTION  63-17-10. Purpose; definitions.(A) The purpose of this article is to establish a procedure to aid in the determination of the paternity of an individual.(B) As used in this article, "child" includes, but is not limited to, a person under the age of eighteen years.(C) An action to establish the paternity of an individual may be brought by:(1) a child;(2) the natural mother of a child;(3) any person in whose care a child has been placed;(4) an authorized agency, including, but not limited to, the Department of Social Services, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 43, and any other person or agency pursuant to the provisions of Sections 63-3-550 and 63-17-340; or(5) a person who claims to be the father of a child.(D) If an action is brought under this article prior to the birth of a child, all proceedings must be stayed until after the birth of the child except the service of a summons and the taking of depositions or other discovery procedures.(E) Whenever an action threatens to make a child illegitimate, the presumed legal father and the putative natural father must be made parties respondents to the action. A child under the age of eighteen years must be represented by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court. Neither the mother nor the presumed or putative father of the child may represent him as guardian ad litem.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-20. Jurisdiction.(A) Any person who has sexual intercourse in this State thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to an action brought under this article with respect to a child who may have been conceived by that act of intercourse. In addition to any other method provided by law, personal jurisdiction may be acquired by service of process outside this State in the manner authorized by the provisions of Section 36-2-806.(B) Unless the court orders otherwise, the custody of an illegitimate child is solely in the natural mother unless the mother has relinquished her rights to the child. If paternity has been acknowledged or adjudicated, the father may petition the court for rights of visitation or custody in a proceeding before the court apart from an action to establish paternity.(C) All actions commenced under this article must be dealt with as separate proceedings before the court without a jury. The general public is to be excluded from these proceedings and only those persons whom the judge finds to have a direct interest in the proceeding or in assisting the court in its work are to be permitted to attend.(D) Any proceeding commenced under this article is a civil action. The natural mother of the child and the alleged father are competent to testify and may be compelled by the court to appear and give testimony.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-30. Genetic tests; costs.(A) As soon as practicable after an action has been commenced, the court, upon its motion or that of an interested party, may order the natural mother, the putative father, and the child to submit to genetic tests such as red blood cell antigen testing, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing, electrophoresis, or other tests which have been developed for the purpose of proving or disproving parentage and which are reasonably accessible. If the court orders any of these tests, and if the action is commenced prior to the birth of the child, the court shall also order that the tests be made as soon as medically feasible after the birth of the child. The tests must be performed under the supervision of a qualified expert. In all cases the court shall determine the number and the qualifications of experts, except that the parties may submit for the court's approval a written stipulation regarding experts and facilities to be used for testing. The costs of any tests not disposed of by written stipulation must be paid by the parties as ordered by the court. However, in any action initiated pursuant to Section 43-5-220 where the court determines that the respondent is indigent, the court may order that these costs be borne by the petitioner. When the State of South Carolina is the petitioner and the respondent is indigent and the court orders the petitioner to pay these costs, they must be paid from amounts collected under the Child Support Enforcement Program (Title IV-D).(B) For all child support cases administered under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, the child and all other parties in a contested paternity case, upon the request of any party to the action, must be ordered by the court to submit to the genetic testing, as provided for in subsection (A), to determine paternity. This testing is not required where the individual involved has good cause for failing to cooperate pursuant to the provisions of Section 402(a)(26)(B) of the Social Security Act or where the court determines that paternity has been previously established by operation of law or judicial finding of fact.(C) For all child support cases not administered under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, the child and all parties in a contested paternity case, upon the request of any party to the action, must be ordered by the court to submit to the genetic testing, as provided for in subsection (A), to determine paternity. This testing is not required where the court determines that good cause, including the presumption of legitimacy, not to order the test exists or where the court determines that paternity has been established previously by operation of law or judicial finding of fact.(D) Any order issued under this section is enforceable by contempt.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-40. Settlement and voluntary agreements.(A) The court must encourage settlements and voluntary agreements and must examine and approve them whenever they are warranted. Upon a finding of fairness the court shall approve, without a hearing, settlements and voluntary agreements which are reduced to writing, signed by the parties, and properly verified. The agreement must be accompanied by financial declarations and affidavits from the custodial and noncustodial parents stating that they have read, or have had read to them, and understand the agreement and that they have voluntarily executed the agreement or consent order. The parties may submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court by a settlement or voluntary agreement which must be filed with the summons and complaint. A defendant's affidavit must state that the defendant is capable of fulfilling any financial requirements of the agreement or consent order applicable to the defendant. Upon the court's approval, the settlement or voluntary agreement becomes an order of the court.(B) In actions commenced by the Department of Social Services or any other authorized agency, an employee of the department or the agency who is familiar with the action may make, on behalf of the custodial parent, the required affidavit accompanying a settlement, voluntary agreement, or consent order. In cases where the child is the recipient of public assistance, the affidavit must state that the employee has reviewed the case and that the child involved is receiving public assistance due in part to inadequate support from the noncustodial parent.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-50. Verified voluntary acknowledgments.(A) A verified voluntary acknowledgment of paternity creates a legal finding of paternity, subject to the right of any signatory to rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of:(1) sixty days; or(2) the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child including a proceeding to establish a support order in which the signatory is a party.(B) Upon the expiration of the sixty-day period provided for in subsection (A), a verified voluntary acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the challenger.(C) In the event of a challenge, legal responsibilities including child support obligations of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment may not be suspended during the challenge except for good cause shown.(D) Judicial or administrative proceedings are not required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment of paternity.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-60. Admissibility of evidence.(A) The following evidence is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity:(1) Results of genetic tests as described in Section 63-17-30 from physicians, agencies, hospitals, laboratories, or other qualified testing facilities, properly verified to show the chain of custody of blood samples. This evidence, must be introduced and admitted without the foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy unless a challenge has been asserted by motion at least twenty days before the date of trial. Any party to the action, absent stipulations to the contrary, may demand the right to have additional testing conducted at the expense of the party who demands the additional testing.(2) The refusal of a party to submit to a genetic or other ordered test as to the credibility of a party.(3) Test results which show a statistical probability of paternity. A statistical probability of paternity of ninety-five percent or higher creates a rebuttable presumption of the putative father's paternity.(4) A verified voluntary acknowledgment of paternity. This acknowledgment creates a rebuttable presumption of the putative father's paternity except that a verified voluntary acknowledgment of paternity executed after January 1, 1998, creates a conclusive presumption of the putative father's paternity subject to the provisions of Section 63-17-50. The person acknowledging paternity must be given the opportunity to seek legal advice prior to signing a verified voluntary acknowledgment. A verified voluntary acknowledgment must be made by a sworn document, signed by the person acknowledging paternity and witnessed by (1) that person's attorney, parent, or guardian or (2) a person eighteen years of age or older who is not related to the child and not employed or acting under the authority of the Department of Social Services. The witness must attach to the acknowledgment a written certification which specifies that prior to signing the acknowledgment, the provisions of the acknowledgment were discussed with the person acknowledging paternity and that, based upon this discussion, it is the witness' opinion that the acknowledgment is being given voluntarily and that it is not being obtained under duress or through coercion.(5) A foreign paternity determination whether established through administrative or judicial process. This determination creates a conclusive presumption of paternity.(6) A birth certificate containing the signature of the mother and the putative father. This evidence creates a rebuttable presumption of paternity.(7) An expert's opinion concerning the time of conception. This evidence is admissible in the same manner as other expert testimony. The court may take judicial notice of the normal period of gestation.(8) The testimony of a husband and wife as to any relevant matter, including marriage and parentage.(9) Any other relevant and competent evidence deemed admissible in the discretion of the court.(B) Upon the motion of any party to the action or upon its own motion, the court may view a child for the purpose of examining the presence or the absence of physical characteristics and similarities between the child and the putative father.(C) If a male witness offers testimony indicating that his act of intercourse with the natural mother may have resulted in the conception of the child, the court may require the witness to submit to genetic or other tests to determine whether he is the child's father. If the results of the tests exclude or tend to exclude the witness as the father of the child, the witness's testimony must be stricken from the record and disregarded.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-70. Court orders.(A)(1) Upon a finding that the putative father is the natural father of the child, the court must issue an order designating the putative father as the natural father and ordering that the birth certificate be amended to include the name of the father.(2) The order must:(a) set forth the social security numbers, or the alien identification numbers assigned to resident aliens who do not have social security numbers, of both parents;(b) establish a duty of support and provide for child support payments in amounts and at a frequency to be determined by the court; and(c) provide for other relief which has been properly prayed for in the pleadings and which is considered reasonable and just by the court.(B) Upon a finding that the putative father is not the father of the child, the court shall issue an order which sets forth this finding.(C) Upon entry of a court order or an administrative determination that the putative father is the legal father pursuant to subsection (A), the clerk of court shall send a report to the Registrar of the Division of Vital Statistics of the Department of Health and Environmental Control showing such information as may be required on an amended certificate of birth to be furnished by the Division of Vital Statistics of the Department of Health and Environmental Control.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2019 Act No. 42 (S.21), § 1, eff May 16, 2019.Article 3. Child Support General Provisions
SECTION  63-17-325. Child support obligations start at date of conception.(A) A biological father of a child has a duty to pay the mother of the child the following financial obligations beginning with the date of conception:(1) child support payment obligations in an amount determined pursuant to Section 63-17-470;(2) fifty percent of the mother's pregnancy expenses.(a) Any portion of a mother's pregnancy expenses paid by the mother or the biological father reduces that parent's fifty percent obligation regardless of when the mother or biological father pays the pregnancy expenses.(b) Pregnancy expenses must include fifty percent of the mother's insurance premiums that are not paid by her employer or governmental program beginning from the date of conception and before the pregnancy ends, unless otherwise ordered by the court.(c) Item (2) does not apply if a court apportions pregnancy expenses as part of an award of child support in item (1).(B) In the case of a mother who becomes pregnant as a result of rape or incest, the biological father, in addition to the duties imposed by subsection (A), also is responsible for the full cost of any expenses incurred by the mother for mental health counseling arising out of the rape or incest.(C) The duties imposed by this section accrue at the time of conception and must be applied retroactively when paternity is contested, and medical evidence establishes the paternity of the child. Interest accrues on any retroactive obligations beginning with conception until either the obligations are brought current or paid in full whichever happens first. The rate of interest must be calculated based on the applicable interest rate for money decrees and judgments in this State established annually by the South Carolina Supreme Court.HISTORY: 2023 Act No. 70 (S.474), § 4, eff May 25, 2023.
SECTION  63-17-360. Reconciliation efforts.Except where the circumstances indicate it to be undesirable, in all cases where an application for support has been made, an effort should be made by the judge to restore harmonious relations between the husband and wife and to adjust the issues raised by the application through conciliation and agreement. Where an agreement for the support of the petitioner is brought about, it must be reduced to writing and submitted to the court for approval. Where possible, the court shall see both parties and shall inquire of each whether the agreement, which he must state to them, is what they have agreed to. If it is, and the court shall approve it, the court without further hearing may thereupon enter an order for the support of the petitioner by the respondent in accordance with such agreement, which shall be binding upon the respondent and shall in all respects be a valid order as though it had been made after process has been issued out of the court. The court record shall show that such order was made upon agreement.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-380. Hearing notices.(A) If pursuant to family court rule, the clerk of court issues a rule to show cause in a case of child support or periodic alimony arrearage, the clerk also shall provide written notice to the party owed the support or alimony. The notice to the party owed support or alimony must:(1) be provided by the court at least five days prior to the hearing;(2) be sent by first class delivery through the United States Postal Service and addressed to the party's last address on file with the court; and(3) include the date, time, and place the party in arrears has been ordered to appear.(B) The mailing provided for in subsection (A) is considered sufficient notice of the hearing to the party owed the support or alimony.(C) The clerk of court shall place in the case file a copy of the notice sent to the party owed support or alimony with the time and date stamped on the copy.(D) This section does not apply to a rule to show cause in a case of child support or periodic alimony arrearage issued by a clerk of court pursuant to family court rule if the party owed the support or alimony is represented by the Department of Social Services.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-385. Failure to pay court-ordered child support other than periodic child support payments; affidavit; hearing; costs and attorney's fees.(A) Where a court order requires a parent to provide monetary support for a child in the form of payment of health, medical, educational, or other expenses, excluding periodic child support payments, and the parent fails to do so, the other parent or the child's custodial guardian may petition the court for relief using an authorized affidavit and supporting documents setting forth the existence of the expense and the failure of the parent to pay the required support.(1) Within sixty days of approval of this act by the Governor, Court Administration shall prepare the authorized affidavit form and make it available to petitioners seeking relief under the provisions of this section. The authorized affidavit form must contain the following information:(a) the names and addresses of the petitioner and the parent alleged to have failed to make the support payment;(b) the amount and nature of the support payment the parent allegedly failed to make;(c) the date and manner in which the petitioner notified the alleged nonpaying parent and requested payment;(d) the response, if any, of the alleged nonpaying parent upon receiving the petitioner's request for payment; and(e) if the matter relates to an expense covered by an insurance policy, whether an insurance claim has been filed, and, if so, the insurance carrier's response.(2) The authorized affidavit may be accompanied by the following documents:(a) a copy of the court order requiring the parent to provide monetary support for a child excluding periodic payments of funds for support;(b) a copy of any bill, invoice, or other written document, substantiating the expense the petitioner claims the parent is required to pay;(c) a copy of any written request for payment of the support by the petitioner to the alleged nonpaying parent;(d) a copy of any written reply from the alleged nonpaying parent to the parent responding to the petitioner's request for payment;(e) if the matter relates to an expense covered by an insurance policy, a copy of all correspondence to and from the insurance carrier pertaining to payment of the claim;(f) proof that the petitioner has satisfied that portion of the expense he is required to pay pursuant to the court order; and(g) the current mailing address of the alleged nonpaying parent.(3) Upon receipt of a petition accompanied by an authorized affidavit, the court shall issue a rule to show cause to the alleged nonpaying parent for nonpayment of the required support. The parent must be served in accordance with the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. The court also shall provide notice of the hearing to the petitioner.(B)(1) At the hearing on the rule to show cause, once the petitioner has established his claim, the burden is on the alleged nonpaying parent to establish a defense.(2) The alleged nonpaying parent may assert any defense allowed by law.(3) The petitioner must be present at the hearing and may be called upon to testify.(C) If the family court determines that the claims or defenses of either party are frivolous, or that either party knowingly or intentionally made or filed a false authorized affidavit, or knowingly or intentionally submitted false documents in support of a claim or defense, the court may award to either party attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in the prosecution or defense of the petition.HISTORY: 2010 Act No. 154, § 1, eff August 10, 2010.
SECTION  63-17-400.

SECTION  63-17-450. Information required in paternity and support actions.(A) An obligor and an obligee in a child support or paternity action, whether judicial or administrative, shall provide the following information to the tribunal:(1) residence address;(2) mailing address;(3) telephone number;(4) social security number or the alien identification number assigned to a resident alien who does not have a social security number;(5) driver's license number; and(6) name, address, and telephone number of employer.The parties shall notify the tribunal of any changes to the above-referenced information within ten days of the effective date of the change. In subsequent support actions between the obligor and the obligee or their assignees, upon sufficient showing that diligent effort has been made to ascertain the location of the party, delivery by first-class mail of written notice to the obligor and the obligee at the residential or employer address most recently filed with the tribunal constitutes service of process.(B) "Tribunal" is defined for purposes of this section as the family court or the Department of Social Services, Child Support Enforcement Division or its designee.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-470. Proceedings and awards.(A) In any proceeding for the award of child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines required under Section 43-5-580(b) is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. A different amount may be awarded upon a showing that application of the guidelines in a particular case would be unjust or inappropriate. When the court orders a child support award that varies significantly from the amount resulting from the application of the guidelines, the court shall make specific, written findings of those facts upon which it bases its conclusion supporting that award. Findings that rebut the guidelines must state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and include a justification of why the order varies from the guidelines.(B) Application of these guidelines to an existing child support order, in and of itself, is not considered a change in circumstances for the modification of that existing order, except in a Title IV-D case.(C) The court shall consider the following factors which may be possible reasons for deviation from the guidelines or may be used in determining whether a change in circumstances has occurred which would require a modification of an existing order:(1) educational expenses for the child or children or the spouse, to include those incurred for private, parochial, or trade schools, other secondary schools, or post-secondary education where there is tuition or related costs;(2) equitable distribution of property;(3) consumer debts;(4) families with more than six children;(5) unreimbursed extraordinary medical or dental expenses for the noncustodial or custodial parent;(6) mandatory deduction of retirement pensions and union fees;(7) support obligations for other dependents living with the noncustodial parent or noncourt ordered child support from another relationship;(8) child-related unreimbursed extraordinary medical expenses;(9) monthly fixed payments imposed by a court or operation of law;(10) significant available income of the child or children;(11) substantial disparity of income in which the noncustodial parent's income is significantly less than the custodial parent's income, thus making it financially impracticable to pay what the guidelines indicate the noncustodial parent should pay;(12) alimony; because of their unique nature, lump sum, rehabilitative, reimbursement, or any other alimony that the court may award, may be considered by the court as a possible reason for deviation from these guidelines;(13) agreements reached between parties; the court may deviate from the guidelines based on an agreement between the parties if both parties are represented by counsel or if, upon a thorough examination of any party not represented by counsel, the court determines the party fully understands the agreement as to child support. The court still has the discretion and the independent duty to determine if the amount is reasonable and in the best interest of the child or children.(D) Pursuant to Section 43-5-580(b), the department shall promulgate regulations which establish child support guidelines as a rebuttable presumption. The department shall review these regulations at least once every four years to ensure that their application results in appropriate child support award amounts.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-490. Employment program.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a court or administrative order for child support or order for contempt for nonpayment of child support being enforced under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act may direct a noncustodial parent who is unemployed or underemployed and who is the parent of a child receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits to participate in an employment training program or public service employment. Upon failure of the noncustodial parent to comply with an order of contempt which directed the noncustodial parent to participate in the employment training program or public service employment, the Family Court, upon receiving an affidavit of noncompliance from the department, immediately may issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the noncustodial parent. The Department of Social Services shall promulgate regulations governing the eligibility criteria and implementation of these training programs and public service employment.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-610. Federal mandate for and implementation of State Disbursement Unit.(A) The federal government mandates that every state must have a centralized statewide disbursement unit which collects and disburses child support payments. The federal requirement will result in substantial changes in how spousal and child support payments are collected and disbursed in this State. The required technical solution cannot practically be deployed in every county at the same time and, as a result, the amendments to Sections 63-17-1430, 63-17-1460, 63-17-1580, 63-17-1890, and 63-17-1910 will take effect on a county-by-county basis. The General Assembly finds that the amendments are necessary to comply with the federal requirements.(B) To implement procedures that will accompany deployment of the statewide disbursement unit, the Department of Social Services and the clerks of court shall provide notice to payors as required in subsection (C) below. The Department of Social Services and the clerks of court shall provide general notice to the public showing the date each county will implement the State Disbursement Unit by posting the notice required in subsection (C) on their web sites. This posting constitutes notice of the effective date of the amendments to Sections 63-17-1430, 63-17-1460, 63-17-1580- 63-17-1890, and 63-17-1910.(C) Upon full deployment of the federally mandated single statewide system for child support, the Department of Social Services is authorized to transition to a State Disbursement Unit that will include all child and spousal support, as provided in this act. The department and the clerks of court shall cooperate fully in developing and implementing a transition plan that meets federal requirements and avoids federal financial penalties. The department shall provide notice to each affected support payor directing the payor to make all future payments, beginning thirty days after the department's notices to the payor, to the State Disbursement Unit.(D) The amendments to Sections 63-17-1430, 63-17-1460, 63-17-1580, 63-17-1890, and 63-17-1910 concerning direct payments to the State Disbursement Unit are effective as to all payors receiving the notice specified in this section thirty days after the date of the notice, and effective as to all new cases filed in the county after that date.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 332, § 3.

The division may not enter an order under this section if there is more than one alleged father unless the default applies to only one alleged father and all other alleged fathers have been excluded by the results of genetic testing. If there is more than one alleged father who has not been excluded by the results of genetic testing, the division may petition the court for a hearing to establish paternity.(C) If the rights of others and the interests of justice require, the division may apply to any Family Court for an order compelling an alleged father to submit to genetic testing. The court shall hear the matter as expeditiously as possible. If the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the alleged father is the natural or presumed father of the child, the court shall enter an order compelling the alleged father to submit to a genetic test. As provided in subsection (A), reasonable cause may be established by affidavit of the child's mother.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.

The obligor or obligee may file a written request for modification of an order issued under this article or an existing order of the court with the division by serving the division by certified mail. If the division does not object to the request for modification based upon a showing of changed circumstances as provided by law, the division shall serve the obligor with a notice of financial responsibility as provided in Section 63-17-730 and shall proceed as set forth in this article. If the division objects to the request for modification based upon the failure to demonstrate a showing of changed circumstances, the division shall advise the obligor or obligee that a petition for review may be filed with the Family Court.(B) A request for modification made pursuant to this section does not preclude the division from enforcing and collecting upon the existing order pending the modification proceeding.(C) Only payments accruing subsequent to the modification may be modified.

The department has grounds to file a grievance with the Supreme Court if a licensed attorney is in wilful violation of a court order for child support.(6) "Licensee" means an individual holding a license issued by a licensing entity.(7) "Licensing entity" or "entity" means, for the purposes of issuing or revoking a license, a state, county, or municipal agency, board, department, office, or commission that issues a license.(8) "Order for support" means an order being enforced by the division under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act and which provides for periodic payments of funds for the support of a child or maintenance of a spouse or former spouse and support of a child, whether temporary or final and includes, but is not limited to, an order for reimbursement for public assistance or an order for making periodic payments on a support arrearage.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-1060. Out-of-compliance procedures; notice.(A) The division shall review the information received pursuant to Section 63-17-1050 and determine if a licensee is out of compliance with an order for support. If a licensee is out of compliance with the order for support, the division shall notify the licensee that forty-five days after the licensee receives the notice of being out of compliance with the order, the licensing entity will be notified to revoke the licensee's license unless the licensee pays the arrearage owing under the order or signs a consent agreement establishing a schedule for the payment of the arrearage.(B) Upon receiving the notice provided for in subsection (A), the licensee may:(1) request a review with the division; however, issues the licensee may raise at the review are limited to whether the licensee is the individual required to pay under the order for support and whether the licensee is out of compliance with the order of support; or(2) request to participate in negotiations with the division for the purpose of establishing a payment schedule for the arrearage.(C) The division director or the division director's designees are authorized to and upon request of a licensee shall negotiate with a licensee to establish a payment schedule for the arrearage. Payments made under the payment schedule are in addition to the licensee's ongoing obligation under the order for support.(D) Upon the division and the licensee reaching an agreement on a schedule for payment of the arrearage, the director shall file an agreement and order pursuant to Section 63-17-750(A) and (B) with the family court in the county in which the order for support was issued. The clerk shall stamp the date of receipt of the agreement and order and shall file it under the docket number of the order of support. The agreement and order shall have all the force, effect, and remedies of an order of the court including, but not limited to, wage assignment and contempt of court.(E) If the licensee and the division do not reach an agreement establishing a schedule for payment of the arrearage, the licensee may petition the court to establish a payment schedule. However, this action does not stay the license revocation procedures.(F) The notification given a licensee that the licensee's license will be revoked in forty-five days clearly must state the remedies and procedures available to a licensee under this section.(G) If at the end of the forty-five days the licensee still has an arrearage owing under the order for support or the licensee has not signed a consent agreement establishing a payment schedule for the arrearage, the division shall notify the licensing entity to revoke the licensee's license. A license only may be reinstated if the division notifies the licensing entity that the licensee no longer has an arrearage or that the licensee has signed a consent agreement.(H) Review with the division under this section is the licensee's sole remedy to prevent revocation of his or her license. The licensee has no right to appeal the revocation with the licensing entity.(I) If a licensee under a consent order entered into pursuant to this section, for the payment of an arrearage subsequently is out of compliance with an order for support, the division immediately may notify the licensing entity to revoke the license and the procedures provided for under subsection (B) do not apply; however the appeal provisions of subsection (H) apply. If upon revocation of the license the licensee subsequently enters into a consent agreement or the licensee otherwise informs the department of compliance, the department shall notify the licensing entity within fourteen days of the determination of compliance and the license must be reissued.(J) Notice required to the licensee under this section must be deposited in the United States mail with postage prepaid and addressed to the licensee at the last known address. The giving of the notice is considered complete ten days after the deposit of the notice. A certificate that the notice was sent in accordance with this article creates a presumption that the notice requirements have been met even if the notice has not been received by the licensee.(K) Nothing in this section prohibits a licensee from filing a petition for a modification of a support order or for any other applicable relief. However, no such petition stays the license revocation procedure.(L) If a license is revoked under this section, the licensing entity is not required to refund any fees paid by a licensee in connection with obtaining or renewing a license, and any fee required to be paid to the licensing entity for reinstatement after a license revocation applies. The division will indemnify the applicable licensing entity from any consequences that may result from the revocation of the licensee's license.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-1210. Employer New Hire Reporting program.(A) By January 1, 1996, the Child Support Enforcement Division of the Department of Social Services shall create and develop an Employer New Hire Reporting program. The Employer New Hire Reporting program shall provide a means for employers to voluntarily assist in the state's efforts to locate absent parents who owe child support and collect child support from those parents by reporting information concerning newly hired and rehired employees directly to the division.(B) The following provisions apply to the Employer New Hire Reporting program:(1) An employer doing business in this State may participate in the Employer New Hire Reporting program by reporting to the Child Support Enforcement Division:(a) the hiring of a person who resides or works in this State to whom the employer anticipates paying earnings; or(b) the rehiring or return to work of an employee who was laid off, furloughed, separated, granted leave without pay, or terminated from employment.(2) The Employer New Hire Reporting program applies to a person who is expected to:(a) be employed for more than one month's duration;(b) be paid for more than three hundred fifty hours during a continuous six-month period; or(c) have gross earnings of more than three hundred dollars in each month of employment.(3) An employer who voluntarily reports under item (1) shall submit monthly reports regarding each hiring, rehiring, or return to work of an employee during the preceding month. The report must contain:(a) the employee's name, address, social security number, date of birth, and salary information; and(b) the employer's name, address, and employer identification number.(4) Employers reporting to the Employer New Hire Reporting program shall provide information to the Child Support Enforcement Division by:(a) sending a copy of the new employee's W-4 form;(b) completing a form supplied by the Child Support Enforcement Division; or(c) any other means authorized by the Child Support Enforcement Division for conveying the required information, including electronic transmission or magnetic tapes in compatible formats.(5) An employer is authorized by this section to disclose the information described in item (3) and is not liable to the employee for the disclosure or subsequent use by the Child Support Enforcement Division of the information.(6) Information received by the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce from employers which includes information contained in the reports provided for in this section must be transmitted to the Department of Social Services within fifteen working days after the end of each quarter.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.Article 11. Income Withholding to Enforce Child Support
SECTION  63-17-1410. Definitions.As used in this section:(1) "Arrearage" means the total amount of unpaid support obligations.(2) "Court" as used in this section means Family Court.(3) "Delinquency" means when a support payment owed by an obligor pursuant to an order of support is overdue in an amount equal to at least one month's support obligation.(4) "Income" means any periodic form of payment to an individual regardless of source including, but not limited to, wages, salary, commission, bonuses, compensation as an independent contractor, workers' compensation, disability, annuity and retirement benefits, payments made pursuant to a retirement program, interest, and any other payments made by a person or an agency or department of the federal, state, or local government provided the income excludes:(a) amounts required by law to be withheld, other than creditor claims, including, but not limited to, federal, state, and local taxes, social security and other retirement deductions, and disability contributions;(b) amounts exempted by federal law;(c) public assistance payments.Any other state or local laws which limit or exempt income or the amount or percentage of income that can be withheld do not apply.(5) "Obligee" means an individual or the individual's assignee who is entitled to receive payments pursuant to an order of support.(6) "Obligor" means an individual who is required to make payments pursuant to order for support.(7) "Order for support" means any order of a court or an administrative agency of competent jurisdiction which provides for periodic payments of funds for the support of a child or maintenance of a spouse or former spouse, whether temporary or final, whether incidental to a proceeding for divorce, separation, separate maintenance, paternity, guardianship, or otherwise and includes any order providing for a modification of support payment of an arrearage or reimbursement of support.(8) "Payor" means any payor of income to an obligor. For purposes of this section, the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce is not considered to be a payor.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2008 Act No. 332, § 4.
SECTION  63-17-1420. Orders for support subject to withholding notice.(A) For all Title IV-D cases in which support orders are issued or modified after October 31, 1990, and for all nontitle IV-D cases in which support orders are issued or modified after January 3, 1994, the income of an obligor is subject to immediate withholding as of the effective date of the order without the requirement that an arrearage accumulate. However, income is not subject to withholding if:(1) one of the parties demonstrates and the court finds that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding; or(2) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.(B) All orders for support entered or modified in the State before October 1, 1996, if not otherwise subject to wage withholding, are subject to withholding if a delinquency occurs without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing. These orders must be construed to contain this withholding provision even if the provision has been omitted from the written order; however, the court may order withholding to begin immediately for good cause shown. The court is required to make specified written findings to support immediate withholding.(C) Income withholding must be initiated in all Title IV-D cases upon the request of the obligee without the necessity of a delinquency, if the State approves the request in accordance with the procedures and standards as it may establish. If the obligee requests income withholding pursuant to this section, notice of the request must be provided to the obligor by the clerk of court, and if the obligor objects to the income withholding within ten days after the postmarked date of the notice, a hearing must be held, and the family court shall subject the obligor's income to withholding unless the court finds that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding. Where there is no objection by the obligor after proper notice, the clerk of court shall implement immediate income withholding.(D) If an obligor, whose wages are not withheld and who is not required to pay through the family court, is found to be, or is found to have been, delinquent pursuant to an order for support in an amount equal to three or more month's support obligation, the clerk of court must order the obligor's wages enrolled for wage withholding to begin immediately for the payment of the obligor's support obligation, even if the arrearage has been fully or partially paid at the time of the hearing.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2008 Act No. 332, § 4.
SECTION  63-17-1440. Verified notice of delinquency.(A) If a delinquency occurs, the clerk of court shall prepare, file, and serve on the obligor a verified notice of delinquency within fifteen calendar days of the delinquency if the obligor's address is known or if the address is not known, within fifteen calendar days of locating the obligor. If the obligor makes payments pursuant to an order for support directly to the obligee and the obligee seeks income withholding, the notice of delinquency must be verified by the obligee and then served on the obligor by the clerk of court as with any other notice of delinquency.(B) The verified notice of delinquency must be served on the obligor by regular mail addressed to the obligor's last known address or place of employment. Upon mailing the notice, the clerk of court shall file a certificate of mailing stating the name and address to which the notice was mailed and the date on which it was mailed. If service cannot be effected as set forth in this section, the obligor may be served as prescribed for service in civil actions.(C) The notice of delinquency shall inform the obligor that a delinquency has occurred and shall recite the monthly support obligations of the obligor pursuant to the order of support, the total amount of the arrearage as of the date of the notice, and the amount of income to be withheld. The notice must clearly state that a notice to withhold will be sent to the obligor's current or subsequent payor, income withholding will begin, and that a judgment lien may be imposed against the obligor's personal or real property in the amount of the arrearage pursuant to Section 63-17-1600, unless the obligor files a petition to stay service in accordance with Section 63-17-1450.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2008 Act No. 332, § 4.
SECTION  63-17-1450. Petitions to stay service.(A) The obligor may prevent a notice to withhold from being served on the obligor's payor and prevent the recording of the arrearage pursuant to Section 63-17-1600 by filing a petition to stay service with the clerk of court with jurisdiction of the matter within ten days of the date that the notice of delinquency is postmarked; however, the grounds for granting the petition to stay service are limited to a dispute concerning the identity of the obligor or the existence or amount of the arrearage.(B) Filing of a petition to stay service within the ten days required under this section prohibits the clerk of court from serving the notice to withhold on any payor of the obligor and prohibits the recordation of the arrearage.(C) If a petition to stay service is filed, a hearing on the petition must be held within thirty days of its filing. The obligor, obligee, and Department of Social Services, where appropriate, must be notified by the clerk of court of the date, time, and place of the hearing and the court must decide the matter, notify the obligor, and enter an order granting or denying relief or amending the notice of delinquency within forty-five days of the date the notice of delinquency was mailed to the obligor. If the court finds that a delinquency existed when the notice of delinquency was mailed, the court shall order immediate service of the notice to withhold and the arrearage may be recorded immediately pursuant to Section 63-17-1600. The court shall inform the obligor of the time frame within which withholding is to begin and shall provide the obligor in writing with the information contained in the notice to withhold to be served on the payor with respect to the withholding.(D) Upon filing an affidavit with the court stating that a petition to stay service was not timely filed because the notice of delinquency was not received and that grounds exist for a petition to stay service as stated in subsection (A), the obligor is permitted to file a petition to withdraw the notice to withhold, terminate the withholding procedures, and remove the judgment created by the recording of the arrearage. Income withholding, however, may not be interrupted unless the court enters an order granting the relief sought by the obligor based on the limited grounds for a petition to stay service.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2008 Act No. 332, § 4.
SECTION  63-17-1460. Notice to withhold.(A) Fifteen days following the mailing of the notice of the delinquency to the obligor and if no petition to stay service has been filed, the clerk of court shall serve a notice to withhold on the payor or its agent by regular mail and may record the arrearage pursuant to Section 63-17-1600.(B) The notice to withhold shall:(1) direct any payor to withhold at the obligor's regularly scheduled pay periods an amount which over the period of one month would constitute one month's support obligation plus applicable fees pursuant to this article and costs as provided by Section 63-3-370;(2) direct any payor to withhold an additional amount toward any arrearage until the arrearage is paid in full; however, amounts to be withheld under this item and item (1) may not exceed the limits set forth by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1673(b));(3) direct any payor to notify the clerk if health insurance is available to the obligor for the benefit of children for whom child support is being withheld;(4) state the rights, responsibilities, and liabilities of the payor under this article.(C) The payor shall then deduct the designated amount pursuant to the notice to withhold beginning no later than the next regularly scheduled pay period following the pay period during which the payor was served. Payors need not change their regular payroll pattern and may combine all withheld amounts into one payment to the State Disbursement Unit with an itemized statement showing accounts attributable to each obligor for each obligee. For each instance of withholding of income, the payor is entitled to receive a fee of up to three dollars to be deducted from the income of the obligor in addition to the amounts withheld pursuant to the notice to withhold unless the fee is waived by the payor.(D) If there is more than one notice to withhold on a single obligor, the payor must comply with the notices by withholding the amounts designated in the notices to the extent possible pursuant to the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1673(b)). If the payor cannot fully comply with the notices because the amounts to be withheld would exceed the limits under the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, the payor shall notify the court in writing as to its reasons for failing to fully comply. Priority must be given to current support obligations. In no case may the allocation result in a withholding for one of the support obligations not being implemented.(E) The employer shall promptly pay the amount withheld to the State Disbursement Unit within seven working days of the date income is withheld, in accordance with the notice to withhold and in accordance with any notification received from the clerk of court concerning withholding. The payor shall provide the date on which the income is withheld.(F) After the obligor's arrearage has been satisfied, the clerk of court shall serve the payor by regular mail a notice of reduction of withholding. The notice shall inform the payor of the satisfied amount and direct the payor to discontinue withholding the additional amount as prescribed in the notice.(G) Within twenty days after the obligor is no longer employed by the payor, the payor shall return a copy of the notice to withhold to the clerk of court and shall notify the clerk of court in writing of the date the obligor's employment terminated, the date of the obligor's final paycheck, the obligor's home address, and obligor's new employer and address, if known.(H) Withholding of income from an obligor under this article has priority over any other legal process under state law against the same wages. Payment pursuant to a notice to withhold is a complete defense by the payor against any claims of the obligor or the obligor's creditors as to the sum paid.(I) No payor may discharge, refuse to hire, or otherwise penalize any obligor because of the duty to withhold income.(J) The responsibility of a payor who employs an obligor to withhold support from the pay of the obligor ends when the obligor leaves the employ of the payor. If this termination of employment occurs during the middle of a pay period, the final amount required to be withheld must be proportionately reduced in the same percentage that the time worked has to the time of the full pay period.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2008 Act No. 332, § 4.
SECTION  63-17-1470. Termination or suspension of withholding.(A) The clerk of court may suspend income withholding because of inability to deliver the income withheld to the obligee due to the obligee's failure to provide a mailing address or other means of delivery. Upon relocating the obligee and upon meeting the requirements of notice and service pursuant to this article, income withholding must be reinstated.(B) An obligor may petition the court at any time to terminate income withholding pursuant to a notice to withhold:(1) if there is no longer a current order for support and all arrearages are paid; or(2) if the obligor requests termination and withholding has not been terminated previously and subsequently reinstated and the obligor meets the conditions for an alternative arrangement.However, if termination is granted and subsequently a delinquency occurs, the clerk of court shall reinstate withholding procedures by complying with all requirements for notice and service pursuant to this article.(C) The clerk of court shall serve on the payor by regular mail a copy of any order entered pursuant to this section or Section 63-17-1450(D) that affects the duties of the payor. If service cannot be effected as set forth in this section, the payor may be served as prescribed for service in civil actions.(D) The notice to withhold continues to be binding upon the payor until service of any order of the court entered under this section or Section 63-17-1450(D) or until notice is served on the payor by the clerk of court that the underlying order is, for other reasons such as expiration of the support obligation, no longer in effect.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2; 2008 Act No. 332, § 4.
SECTION  63-17-1600. Recording arrearages.When a delinquency occurs as defined in Section 63-17-1410, the obligor must be given notice pursuant to Section 63-17-1440 of the proposed lien. Where no petition to stay service is timely filed or where no relief is granted to the obligor pursuant to Section 63-17-1450, the arrearage may be recorded or provided for in Section 63-17-1460 in the appropriate index in the office of the Clerk of Court or Register of Deeds. Upon recordation the arrearage has the same force and effect as a judgment and it is cumulative to the extent of any and all past due support, until the arrearage is paid in full. The judgment may be recorded in any county in which the obligor resides or in which he owns real property by the filing of a transcript of judgment in that county. A lien imposed pursuant to this section is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.Article 13. Income Withholding to Enforce Support Obligations on Income Earned Out-of-State

The clerk of court shall compile and transmit promptly to the agency of the other jurisdiction all documentation required to enter a support order for this purpose.

SECTION  63-17-1860. Hearing.(A) At any hearing contesting proposed income withholding based on a support order entered under Section 63-17-1840, the entered order, accompanying sworn or certified statement, and a certified copy of an order for withholding, if any, still in effect constitutes prima facie proof, without further proof or foundation, that the support order is valid, that the amount of current support payments and arrearages is as stated, and that the obligee is entitled to income withholding under the law of the jurisdiction which issued the support order.(B) Once a prima facie case is established, the grounds that may be raised by an obligor to contest the withholding are limited to dispute concerning the identity of the obligor or the existence or amount of the arrearage. The burden is on the obligor to establish these defenses. The burden is on the obligor to establish these defenses.(C) If the obligor presents evidence which constitutes a full or partial defense, the court shall, on the request of the obligee, continue the case to permit further evidence relative to the defense to be adduced by either party but if the obligor acknowledges liability sufficient to entitle the obligee to income withholding, the court shall require income withholding for the payment of current support payments under the support order and of so much of any arrearage as is not in dispute, while continuing the case with respect to those matters still in dispute. The court shall determine those matters still in dispute as soon as possible, and if appropriate shall modify the withholding order to conform to that resolution but may not modify the underlying support order.(D) In addition to other procedural devices available to a party, any party to the proceeding or a guardian ad litem or other representative of the child may adduce testimony of witnesses in another state, including the parties and any of the children, by deposition, by written discovery, by photographic discovery such as videotaped depositions, or by personal appearance before the court by telephone or photographic means.

SECTION  63-17-1890. Receipt of payments by State Disbursement Unit; effect of support order.(A) The notice to withhold shall direct payment to be made to the State Disbursement Unit.

The notice and copy of the order may be sent by first class mail. The notice must explain all of the employer's legal obligations under this article. In cases enforced by the Child Support Enforcement Division of the Department of Social Services, the division shall use the National Medical Support Notice promulgated by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement. Upon receipt of notice and the order, the employer shall:(1) permit the parent to enroll, under the family coverage, a child who is otherwise eligible for the coverage without regard to any enrollment season restrictions;(2) if the parent is enrolled but fails to make application to obtain coverage for the child, enroll the child under family coverage upon application of:(a) the child's other parent;(b) the state agency administering the Medicaid program; or(c) the state agency administering 42 U.S.C.

SECTION  63-17-2140.

SECTION  63-17-2310. Clerk of court authority to attempt to locate and right to obtain information from organizations.(A) The Department of Social Services shall attempt to locate individuals for the purposes of establishing paternity and establishing, modifying, and enforcing child support obligations. In all cases not being administered pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act by the department, the clerk of court may attempt to locate individuals for the purpose of enforcing child support obligations.

SECTION  63-17-2330. Immunity from liability.(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of federal or state law, a financial institution, as defined in Section 63-17-2310(A)(2), is not liable to a person for disclosure of information to the Department of Social Services, its designee, or the department's or designee's employees under Section 63-17-2320 for encumbering or surrendering any deposits, credits, or other personal property in response to a notice of lien or levy by the department, or its designee, or for any other action taken in good faith to comply with the requirements of Sections 63-17-2310 and 63-17-2320.(B) Upon obtaining a financial record of an individual from a financial institution pursuant to Sections 63-17-2310 and 63-17-2320, the department, its designee, or the department's or designee's employees may disclose the financial record only for the purpose of, and to the extent necessary in, establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support obligation of the individual.(C) If the department, its designee, or the department's or designee's employees knowingly or by reason of negligence disclose a financial record of an individual in violation of subsection (B), the individual whose records were disclosed may bring a civil action for damages against the department, its designee, or the department's or designee's employees in a district court of the United States.(D) No liability arises under subsection (C) with respect to any disclosure which results from a good faith but erroneous interpretation of subsection (B).(E) In an action brought under subsection (C), upon a finding of liability on the part of the defendant, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in an amount equal to the sum of:(1) the greater of:(a) one thousand dollars for each act of unauthorized disclosure of a financial record with respect to which the defendant is found liable; or(b) the sum of:(i) the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the unauthorized disclosure; and(ii) in the case of a wilful disclosure or a disclosure which is the result of gross negligence, punitive damages; and(2) the costs, including attorney fees, of the action.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.Article 19. Credit Reporting of Child Support Arrearages
SECTION  63-17-2710. Child support arrearage liens.A child support obligation which is unpaid in an amount equal to or greater than one thousand dollars, as of the date on which it was due, is a lien in favor of the obligee in an amount sufficient to satisfy unpaid child support, whether the amount due is a fixed sum or is accruing periodically. An amount of restitution established by the Department of Social Services, Child Support Enforcement Division, or its designee (division) or the family court is due and payable as of the date the amount is established. The lien shall incorporate any unpaid child support which may accrue in the future and does not terminate except as provided in Section 63-17-2730. Upon recordation or registration in accordance with Section 63-17-2730, the lien shall encumber all tangible and intangible property, whether real or personal, and an interest in property, whether legal or equitable, belonging to the obligor. An interest in property acquired by the obligor after the child support lien arises is subject to the lien, subject to the limitations provided in Section 63-17-2730.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-2730. Notice of a lien, filing, expiration.(A)(1) The division shall file notice of a lien with respect to real property with the register of deeds for any county in the State where the obligor owns property. The social security number, or the alien identification number assigned to a resident alien who does not have a social security number, of the obligor must be noted on the notice of the lien. The filing operates to perfect a lien when recorded, as to any interest in real property owned by the obligor that is located in the county where the lien is recorded. Liens created under this section must be maintained by the register of deeds of each county of the State, in accordance with established local procedures for recordation. If the obligor subsequently acquires an interest in real property, the lien is perfected upon the recording of the instrument by which the interest is obtained in the register of deeds where the notice of the lien was filed within six years prior thereto. A child support lien is perfected as to real property when both the notice thereof and a deed or other instrument in the name of the obligor are on file in the register of deeds for the county where the obligor owns property without respect to whether the lien or the deed or other instrument was recorded first.(2) The division also shall file notice of a child support lien, with the social security number, or the alien identification number assigned to a resident alien who does not have a social security number, of the obligor on the notice, with respect to personal property with the Department of Natural Resources, a county, or other office or agency responsible for the filing or recording of liens. The filing of a notice of a lien or of a waiver or release of a lien must be received and registered or recorded without payment of a fee. The division may file notice of a lien or waiver or release of a lien or may transmit information to or receive information from any registry of deeds or other office or agency responsible for the filing or recording of liens by any means, including electronic means. Any lien placed against a vehicle with a title issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles is not perfected until notation of the lien is recorded on the vehicle's title by the Department of Motor Vehicles. No fee is required to reissue this title. The perfected lien is not subordinate to a recorded lien except a lien that has been perfected before the date on which the child support lien was perfected. The division, upon request of the obligor, may subordinate the child support lien to a subsequently perfected mortgage. To assist in the collection of a debt by the division, the division may disclose the name of an obligor against whom a lien has arisen and other identifying information including the existence of the lien and the amount of the outstanding obligation.(B) The lien expires upon termination of a current child support obligation and payment in full of unpaid child support or upon release of the lien by the division. In any event, a lien under this section expires six years from the date on which the lien was first perfected. The lien may be extended for additional periods of six years each by recording, during the fifth year of the lien, a further notice of the lien, as provided in subsection (A), without affecting the priority of the lien. Expiration of the lien does not terminate the underlying order or judgment of child support. The division may issue a full or partial waiver of a lien imposed under this section. The waiver or release is conclusive evidence that the lien upon the property covered by the waiver or release is extinguished.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.
SECTION  63-17-2740. Levy upon property; refusal to surrender; discharge of obligation.(A) If an obligor against whom a lien has arisen and has been perfected under Section 63-17-2730 neglects or refuses to pay the sum due after the expiration of the thirty-day notice period specified in Section 63-17-2720, the division may collect the unpaid child support and levy upon all property as provided in this section. For the purposes of this section, "levy" includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means. A person in possession of property upon which a lien having priority under Section 63-17-2730 has been perfected, upon demand, shall surrender the property to the division as pursuant to this section. Financial institutions which hold assets of an obligor, after proper identification and notification by the division, shall encumber or surrender deposits, credits, or other personal property held by the institution on behalf of an obligor who is subject to a child support lien, pursuant to Section 63-17-2320. Financial institutions are allowed to either submit account information directly to the State where it is matched against the parent data base, or financial institutions may request a file and complete the comparison and submit it directly to the State. The social security number must be used for the matching process and not the full name of the person who maintains an account with that entity. A levy on property held by an organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract, without necessity for the surrender of the contract document, constitutes a demand by the division for payment of the amount of the lien and the exercise of the right of the obligor to the advance of the amount. The organization shall pay the amount ninety days after service of the notice of levy. The levy is considered satisfied if the organization pays over to the division the full amount which the obligor could have had advanced to him, if the amount does not exceed the amount of the lien. Whenever any property upon which levy has been made is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the state for which levy is made, the division thereafter, as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy, without further notice, upon any other property of the obligor subject to levy upon first perfecting its lien as provided in Section 63-17-2730, until the amount due from the obligor and the expenses are fully paid. With respect to a seizure or levy of real property or tangible personal property, the sheriff shall proceed in the manner prescribed by Sections 15-39-610, et seq., insofar as these sections are not inconsistent with this article. The division has rights to property remaining after satisfying superior perfected liens, as provided in Section 63-17-2730.(B) Upon demand by the division, a person who fails or refuses to surrender property subject to levy pursuant to this section is liable in his own person and estate to the State in a sum equal to the value of the property not so surrendered but not exceeding the amount of the lien, and the costs at the rate established by Section 23-19-10.(C) A person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property who, upon demand by the division, surrenders the property or discharges the obligations to the division or who pays a liability under this article, must be discharged from any obligation or liability to the obligor arising from the surrender or payment. A levy on an organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract which is satisfied pursuant to this article, discharges the organization from any obligation or liability to any beneficiary arising from the surrender or payment.HISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, § 2.

Conditions for modification.(A) If Section 63-17-3850 does not apply, upon petition, a tribunal of this State may modify a child-support order issued in another state which is registered in this State if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that:(1) the following requirements are met:(a) neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;(b) a petitioner who is a nonresident of this State seeks modification; and(c) the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State; or(2) this State is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this State to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.(B) Modification of a registered child-support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this State and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.(C) A tribunal of this State may not modify any aspect of a child-support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.

The director or his designee shall notify in writing the insurer, as soon as is practicable, which has filed the premium rates of his approval or disapproval with the department. In the event of disapproval, the notice must contain the reasons for disapproval, and the insurer is entitled to appeal the decision or determination of disapproval before the Administrative Law Court as provided by law. If no action has been taken to approve or disapprove the premium rates after they have been filed for ninety days, they are deemed to be approved.(C) At any time the director or his designee, after a public hearing of which at least thirty days' written notice has been given, may withdraw approval of forms or rates previously approved under subsections (A) and (B) if he determines that the forms or rates no longer meet the standards for approval specified in subsections (A) and (B).(D) The provisions of this section do not apply to policies issued in connection with loans made under the Small Loan Act of 1966.(E) For major medical expense coverage individual accident and health insurance policies, as defined by regulation of the department, the benefits are deemed reasonable in relation to the premium charged if the insurer has filed a loss ratio guarantee with the department. This guaranteed loss ratio must be equivalent to, or greater than, the most recent loss ratios detailed within the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' "Guidelines for Filing of Rates for Individual Health Insurance Forms". This loss ratio guarantee must be in writing and must contain at least the following:(1) A recitation of the anticipated (target) loss ratio standards contained in the original actuarial memorandum filed with the policy form when it was originally approved.(2) A guarantee that the actual South Carolina loss ratios for the calendar year in which the new rates take effect, and for each year thereafter until new rates are filed will meet or exceed the loss ratio standards referred to in item (1).(3) A guarantee that the actual South Carolina loss ratio results for the year at issue will be independently audited at the insurer's expense.

The refund must be made to all South Carolina policyholders insured under the applicable policy form as of the last day of the year at issue if the refund would equal five dollars or more. The refund must include statutory interest from the end of the year at issue until the date of payment. Payments must be made during the third quarter of the next year.(5) As used herein, the term "loss ratio" means the ratio of incurred losses to earned premium by number of years of policy duration, for all combined durations.(6) The reference in item (1) of this subsection to the "anticipated (target) loss ratio standards contained in the original actuarial memorandum filed with the policy form when it was originally approved" may not be considered or construed as evidence of legislative intent that the use of, or adherence to, such "anticipated (target) loss ratio standards" is approved or disapproved in any application for a rate increase for any policy form approved prior to the effective date of these amendments to Section 38-71-310.(F) Nothing in this chapter precludes the issuance of an individual accident, health, or accident and health insurance policy that includes an optional life insurance rider.

Later acceptance of the premium by the company or by an agent authorized to accept payment without requiring an application for reinstatement will reinstate the policy. If the company or its agent requires an application, the insured will be given a conditional receipt for the premium. If the application is approved, the policy will be reinstated as of the approval date. Lacking such approval, the policy will be reinstated on the forty-fifth day after the date of the conditional receipt unless the company has previously written the insured of its disapproval. The reinstated policy will cover only loss that results from an injury sustained after the date of reinstatement or sickness that starts more than ten days after such date.In all other respects the rights of the insured and the company will remain the same, subject to any provisions noted on or attached to the reinstated policy. Any premiums the company accepts for reinstatement will be applied to a period for which premiums have not been paid.

The insured need not do this if legally incapacitated. The first six months after any filing of proof by the insured or any payment or denial of a claim by the company will not be counted in applying this provision.If the insured delays in giving this notice, the insured's right to any benefits for the six months before the date when the insured gives notice will not be impaired.(6) A provision as follows:CLAIM FORMS:When the company receives notice of claim, it will send the claimant forms for filing proof of loss. If these forms are not given to the claimant within fifteen days the claimant will meet the proof of loss requirements by giving the company a written statement of the nature and extent of the loss within the time limits stated in the Proofs of Loss section.(7) A provision as follows:PROOFS OF LOSS:If the policy provides for periodic payment for a continuing loss, written proof of loss must be given the company within ninety days after the end of each period for which the company is liable. For any other loss, written proof must be given within ninety days after such loss.

The company will be discharged to the extent of any such payment made in good faith.Optional paragraph: The company may pay all or a portion of any indemnities provided for health care services to the provider, unless the insured directs otherwise in writing by the time proofs of loss are filed.

However, the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of these provisions a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the director or his designee which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this section, or, at the option of the insurer, by appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions approved by the director or his designee.(1) A provision as follows:CHANGE OF OCCUPATION:If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent.In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.(2) A provision as follows:MISSTATEMENT OF AGE:If the insured's age has been misstated, the benefits will be those the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.(3) A provision as follows:OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER:If the insured has more than one policy __________ [insert designation for limitation such as policy form-type-form], only one policy chosen by the insured will be effective.

The premiums paid for the excess must be returned to the insured.Or, in lieu thereof:Insurance effective at one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary, or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.On every application for insurance the insurer shall ask for the amount of insurance which the applicant currently has in force with such insurer. If the insurer fails to ascertain the amount of insurance which an applicant has in force, all policies issued by the insurer to the applicant remain in force and the insurer is liable for all benefits payable thereunder, unless the applicant has misrepresented the amount of existing coverage on the application.In all cases where the applicant indicates that other life, accident, and health insurance is in force with the insurer or the insurer's company, the insurer shall provide the applicant with the total amount of existing coverage with the insurer or insurer's company within sixty days.(4) A provision as follows:INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS:If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision-of-service basis or on an expense-incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense-incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision-of-service basis, the "like amount" of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.[If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set out in item (5) of this section, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase "EXPENSE-INCURRED BENEFITS".

In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations.For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be "other valid coverage" of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third-party liability coverage shall be included as "other valid coverage".](5) A provision as follows:INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS:If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense-incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro ratio portion for the indemnities thus determined.[If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set out in item (4) of this section, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase "OTHER BENEFITS". The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "other valid coverage" approved as to form by the director or his designee, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director or his designee. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be "other valid coverage" of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third-party liability coverage shall be included as "other valid coverage".](6) A provision as follows:RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE:If the total monthly amount of loss-of-time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss-of-time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro ratio amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of two hundred dollars or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time. [The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of the premiums (a) until at least age fifty or (b) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid loss-of-time coverage", approved as to form by the director or his designee, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director or his designee or any combination of such coverages.

SECTION  38-71-730. Requirements for group accident, group health, and group accident and health policies.No policy of group health, group accident, or group accident and health insurance may be delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless it conforms to the following description:(1) Except as provided in this item, the policy is issued to a trust or to insure two or more persons who are associated in a common group for purposes other than the obtaining of insurance.(a) Group policies of credit accident and health insurance may be issued to persons other than those in a common group.(b) A common group of small employers may be formed solely for the purpose of obtaining insurance. Such a group must comply with the following provisions:(i) It contains at least one thousand eligible employees.(ii) It establishes requirements for membership. However, the common group cannot exclude any small employer, which otherwise meets the requirements for membership, on the basis of claim experience or any health status-related factors, as defined in Section 38-71-840, in relation to the employee or a dependent of the employee.(iii) It holds an open enrollment period at least once a year during which new members can join the common group.(iv) It allows eligible employees and their dependents, upon initial enrollment and during subsequent open enrollment periods, to choose among health insurance plans offered through the group. Persons covered by a health insurance plan offered through the group which requires an enrollment period in excess of one year are eligible to choose among available plans upon the completion of the enrollment period.(v) It offers coverage under all plans offered through the group to all eligible employees of member small employers and their dependents. Coverage may not be offered only to certain employees of member small employers and their dependents except as provided in Section 38-71-1370(B) of this chapter.(vi) It does not assume any risk or form self-insurance plans among its members unless it complies with the provisions of Chapter 41 of this title.(vii) It has the option of using any type of rating arrangement with the health insurance plans and, at its discretion, premiums may be paid to the health insurance plans by the common group, by member small employers, or by eligible employees and their dependents.(A) Health insurance plans offered through the common group which rate each member small employer separately are subject to the laws governing small employer health insurance; and(B) Health insurance plans offered through the common group which rate the entire group as a whole must charge each insured person based on a community rate within the common group, adjusted for case characteristics as permitted by Section 38-71-940 and plan selection, and are subject to the laws governing group accident and health insurance.(viii) It may not act as an agent or engage in any activities for which an insurance agent's license is required.(ix) Before offering any health insurance plans through the common group, and annually thereafter, it registers with the department and demonstrates continued compliance with the subitems (b)(i) through (viii).(2) The benefits provided by the policy are based on some plan or plans precluding individual selection, except that insurance supplemental to the basic coverage may be available to persons insured under the policy.(3) For all groups, no evidence of individual insurability may be required at the time the person first becomes eligible for insurance or within thirty-one days thereafter. Nothing in this section precludes the obtaining of medical information with respect to the members of the group for use in determining the insurability of the group, but the information may not be used to exclude an individual from coverage. In addition, group health insurance coverage, as defined in Section 38-71-840 must adhere to the requirements of Section 38-71-860 prohibiting discrimination against individual participants and beneficiaries based on health status-related factors.(4) Except for group health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, the policies may contain a provision limiting coverage for preexisting conditions. The preexisting conditions must be covered no later than twelve months without medical care, treatment, or supplies ending after the effective date of the coverage or twelve months after the effective date of the coverage, whichever occurs first. Policies of disability income insurance may exclude coverage for disabilities beginning during the first twelve months after the effective date of coverage which result from a preexisting condition. Preexisting conditions are defined as those conditions for which medical advice or treatment was received or recommended no more than twelve months before the effective date of a person's coverage. However, whenever a covered person moves from one insured group to another, the insurer of the group to which the covered person moves shall give credit for the satisfaction of the preexisting condition period or portion thereof already served under the prior plan if the coverage is selected when the person first becomes eligible and the coverage is continuous to a date not more than thirty days prior to the effective date of the new coverage. Service under a probationary waiting period required by the employer is not considered to interrupt continuous service. The requirements with respect to limitations on preexisting condition exclusions for group health insurance coverage are described in Section 38-71-850.(5) Except as provided in item (1)(b)(vii) of this section, the premium for the policy must be paid by the policyholder from the policyholder's funds or from funds contributed by the insured persons, or from both.(6) A group policy or subscriber contract of accident and health insurance which is advertised, marketed, or designed primarily as a supplement to reimbursements under Medicare for the hospital, medical, or surgical expenses of persons eligible for Medicare must equal, and may exceed, the minimum standards for Medicare supplement policies as contained in regulations promulgated by the department.HISTORY: Former 1976 Code § 38-35-940 [1947 (45) 322; 1952 Code § 37-532; 1957 (50) 165; 1962 Code § 37-532; 1971 (57) 518; 1976 Act No. 732 § 6; 1982 Act No. 318] recodified as § 38-71-730 by 1987 Act No. 155, § 1; 1988 Act No. 339, § 2; 1990 Act No. 362, § 1; 1991 Act No. 131, §§ 6, 7; 1992 Act No. 283, § 1; 1992 Act No. 286, § 1; 1993 Act No. 181, § 767; 1994 Act No. 339, § 17; 1996 Act No. 435, § 1; 1997 Act No. 5, §§ 6 to 8.
SECTION  38-71-735. Required provisions.No policy of group accident, group health, or group accident and health insurance may be delivered in this State unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or provisions which in the opinion of the director or his designee are more favorable to the persons insured, or at least as favorable to the persons insured, and more favorable to the policyholder. However, (1) items (f) and (k) do not apply to policies issued to a creditor; (2) the standard provisions required for individual policies do not apply to group policies; and (3) if any provision of this section is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy, the insurer, with the approval of the director or his designee, shall omit from the policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in a manner as to make the provision contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the policy:(a) A provision that the policyholder is entitled to a grace period of thirty-one days for the payment of any premium due except the first, during which grace period the policy continues in force, unless the policyholder has given the insurer written notice of discontinuance in advance of the date of discontinuance and in accordance with the terms of the policy. The policy may provide that the policyholder is liable to the insurer for the payment of a pro ratio premium for the time the policy was in force during the grace period.(b) A provision that the validity of the policy may not be contested after it has been in force for two years from its date of issue and that no statement, except fraudulent misstatements, made by any person covered under the policy relating to insurability may be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which the statement was made after the insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of two years during the person's lifetime nor unless it is contained in a written instrument signed by the person making the statement. The provision does not preclude the assertion at any time of defenses based upon the person's ineligibility for coverage under the policy or upon other provisions in the policy.(c) A provision that a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder must be attached to the policy when issued, that all statements made by the policyholder or by the persons insured are considered representations and not warranties, and that no statement made by any person insured may be used in any contest unless a copy of the instrument containing the statement is or has been furnished to the person or, in the event of the death or incapacity of the insured person, to the individual's beneficiary or personal representative.(d) A provision setting forth the conditions, if any, under which the insurer reserves the right to require a person eligible for insurance to furnish evidence of individual insurability satisfactory to the insurer as a condition to part or all of the individual's coverage.(e) If the premiums or benefits vary by age, there must be a provision specifying an equitable adjustment of premiums or of benefits, or both, to be made in the event the age of a covered person has been misstated. The provision must contain a clear statement of the method of adjustment to be used.(f) A provision that the insurer will issue to the policyholder for delivery to each person insured a certificate setting forth a statement as to the insurance protection to which that person is entitled, to whom the insurance benefits are payable, and a statement as to any family member's or dependent's coverage.(g) A provision that written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy. Failure to give notice within the time does not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it can be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give the notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.(h) A provision that the insurer will furnish to the person making claim, or to the policyholder for delivery to such person, such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not furnished before the expiration of fifteen days after the insurer received notice of any claim under the policy, the person making the claim is considered to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which claim is made.(i) A provision that in the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within ninety days after the commencement of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that subsequent written proofs of the continuance of the disability must be furnished to the insurer at intervals the insurer may reasonably require, and that in the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within ninety days after the date of the loss. Failure to furnish proof within the time does not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to furnish the proof within that time so long as the proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity of the claimant, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.(j) A provision that all benefits payable under the policy other than benefits for loss of time will be paid not more than sixty days after receipt of proof of the loss. Subject to proof of loss, all accrued benefits payable under the policy for loss of time will be paid not less frequently than monthly during the continuance of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of liability will be paid as soon as possible after receipt of the proof.(k) A provision that benefits for loss of life of the person insured are payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured. If the policy contains conditions pertaining to family status the beneficiary may be the family member specified by the policy terms. In either case, payment of these benefits is subject to the provisions of law of this State if no such designated or specified beneficiary is living at the death of the person insured. All other benefits of the policy are payable to the person insured. The policy also may provide that if any benefit is payable to the estate of a person or to a person who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the benefit, up to an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars, to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the person who is considered by the insurer to be equitably entitled to the benefit.(l) A provision that the insurer at its own expense may examine the person of the individual for whom claim is made as often as reasonably necessary while a claim is pending and in cases of death of the insured the insurer at its own expense also may have an autopsy performed during the period of contestability unless prohibited by law. The autopsy must be performed in this State.(m) A provision that no action at law or in equity may be brought to recover on the policy before the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been filed in accordance with the requirements of the policy and that no such action may be brought at all unless brought within six years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.(n) In the case of a policy issued to a creditor, a provision that the insurer will furnish the policyholder for delivery to each debtor insured under the policy a certificate of insurance describing the coverage and specifying that the benefits payable first must be applied to reduce or extinguish the indebtedness.HISTORY: 1988 Act No. 394, § 10; 1993 Act No. 181, § 768.
SECTION  38-71-737. Requirement of coverage for psychiatric conditions in group health insurance policies; "psychiatric conditions" defined.(A) An offer to sell a group health insurance policy must include an offer of an optional rider or endorsement to provide benefits for psychiatric conditions as defined in this section. The offer of coverage may contain provisions prescribing different benefits for psychiatric conditions and physical conditions with respect to any deductible amount, coinsurance provision, or contract term affecting benefit determinations based upon use or nonuse of preferred providers.(B) The offer of an optional rider or endorsement for a group health insurance policy must provide minimum benefits for psychiatric conditions not less than two thousand dollars for each member for each benefit year with a lifetime maximum benefit of ten thousand dollars. In the case of group health insurance coverage, as defined in Section 38-71-840, the requirements of Section 38-71-880 regarding parity in the application of certain limits to mental health benefits shall apply to those benefits defined as mental health benefits in Section 38-71-880(E). However, if group health insurance coverage is exempted from the requirements of Section 38-71-880, then the requirements of this provision shall apply. In addition, for group health insurance coverage, the requirements of this provision shall apply to benefits for psychiatric conditions which are not considered mental health benefits.(C) This section does not prohibit an insurer from issuing or continuing to issue a health insurance policy which provides benefits greater than the minimum benefits required by this section or benefits generally more favorable to the insured than those required by this section.(D) As used in this section, "psychiatric conditions" means those mental and nervous conditions, drug and substance addiction or abuse, alcoholism, or other conditions that are defined, described, or classified as psychiatric disorders or conditions in the most current publication of the American Psychiatric Association entitled "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders".HISTORY: 1994 Act No. 377, § 1; 1997 Act No. 5, § 9.
SECTION  38-71-760. Standards for group accident and health insurance coverage, discontinuance, and replacement.(a) This section applies to a group accident, group health, or group accident and health insurance or health maintenance organization policy or certificate that is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this State which provides hospital, surgical, or major medical expense insurance, or any combination of these coverages, on an expense incurred basis. It specifically includes a certificate issued under a policy that was issued to a trust located out of the State but which includes participating units located in the State. Renewal of these policies or certificates is presumed to occur on the anniversary date of the date that coverage was first effective unless another renewal date is specifically stated in the certificate.(b) If a policy or contract subject to this article provides for automatic discontinuance of the policy or contract after a premium or subscription charge has remained unpaid through the grace period allowed for the payment, the carrier is liable for valid claims for covered losses incurred prior to the end of the grace period.(c) If the actions of the carrier after the end of the grace period indicate that it considers the policy or contract as continuing in force beyond the end of the grace period such as by continuing to recognize claims subsequently incurred, the carrier is liable for valid claims for losses beginning on or before the effective date of the written notice of discontinuance to the policyholder or other entity responsible for making payments or submitting subscription charges to the carrier. The effective date of discontinuance may not be prior to midnight at the end of the third scheduled work day after the date upon which the notice is delivered.(d) In addition to the notice required under Section 38-71-870 or Section 38-71-675, any notice of discontinuance by the carrier shall include a request to the group policyholder or other entity involved to notify certificate holders covered under the policy or subscriber contract of the date when the group policy or contract will discontinue and advise that, unless otherwise provided in the policy or contract, the carrier is not liable for claims for losses incurred after such date. The notice also shall advise, when the plan involves certificate holder contributions, that, if the policyholder or other entity continues to collect contributions for the coverage beyond the date of discontinuance, the policyholder or other entity may be held solely liable for the benefits for which the contributions are collected.(e) The carrier shall prepare and furnish to the policyholder or other entity at the same time an appropriate sample notice form to be distributed to the certificate holders concerned indicating the effective date of the discontinuance and urge the certificate holders to refer to their certificates or contracts in order to determine what rights are available to them as a result of the discontinuance.(f) Every group policy, contract, or certificate issued subject to this article or under which the level of benefits is modified or amended shall provide a reasonable provision for extension of benefits in the event of total disability at the date of discontinuance of the group policy, contract, or certificate as required by the following subsections.(g) In the case of a group life plan which contains a disability benefit extension of any type such as premium waiver extension, extended death benefit in the event of total disability, or payment of income for a specified period during total disability, the discontinuance of the group policy, contract or certificate does not operate to terminate the extension.(h) In the case of a group plan providing benefits for loss of time from work or specific indemnity during hospital confinement, discontinuance of the group policy, contract or certificate during a disability has no effect on benefits payable for that disability or confinement.(i) In the case of hospital or medical expense coverages other than dental expense, a reasonable extension of benefits or accrued liability provision is required. The provision is considered reasonable if it provides an extension of at least twelve months under major medical and comprehensive medical type coverages and under other types of hospital or medical expense coverages provides either an extension of at least ninety days or an accrued liability for expenses incurred during a period of disability or during a period of at least ninety days starting with a specific event which occurred while coverage was in force such as an accident.(j) Any applicable extension of benefits or accrued liability must be described in any policy, contract, or certificate involved. The benefits payable during any period of extension or accrued liability are subject to the policy's, contract's, or certificate's regular benefit limits such as benefits ceasing at exhaustion of a benefit period or of maximum benefits. For hospital or medical expense coverages, the benefit payments are limited to payments applicable to the disabling condition only. However, the carrier may not charge any premium during any period of extension.(k) A replacement carrier is considered to be a succeeding carrier within the meaning of this section if the effective date of the coverage provided by it is sixty-two days or less after the date of termination of coverage of the prior carrier.(l) This subsection applies to the prior carrier.(1) The prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits. The position of the prior carrier is the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage.(2) For health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, in all situations except the prior carrier's withdrawal from the large group market, the small group market or both markets in this State, the liability of the prior carrier for extension of benefits terminates at the earliest of the following:(A) The date the individual has full coverage for the disabling condition under a group health plan with similar benefits and that plan makes reasonable provision for continuity of care for the disabling condition.(B) The date the individual is no longer totally disabled.(C) The date the extension period required in subparagraph (i) expires.(D) The date of exhaustion of a benefit period of the payment of maximum benefits as provided for in subparagraph (j).(m) This subsection applies to all groups.(1) Each person who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits with respect to classes eligible and actively at work and nonconfinement rules must be covered by the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits. For health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, nonconfinement rules are not permitted and absence from work due to any health status-related factor must be treated as being actively at work.(2) Each person not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with item (1) of this subsection (m) nevertheless must be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan. Any reference in the following rules to an individual who was or was not totally disabled is a reference to the individual's status immediately prior to the date the succeeding carrier's coverage becomes effective.(A) The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier must be the applicable level of benefits of the succeeding carrier's plan reduced by any benefits payable by the prior plan.(B) Coverage must be provided by the succeeding carrier until at least the earliest of the following dates:(i) The date the individual becomes eligible under the succeeding carrier's plan as described in item (1) of this subsection (m).(ii) For each type of coverage, the date the individual's coverage would terminate in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan provisions applicable to individual termination of coverage, such as at termination of employment or ceasing to be an eligible dependent, as the case may be.(iii) In the case of an individual who was totally disabled, and in the case of a type of coverage for which subsections (f) through (j) of this section require an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the end of any period of extension or accrued liability which is required of the prior carrier by those subsections or, if the prior carrier's policy or contract is not subject to those subsections, would have been required of that carrier had its policy or contract been subject to those subsections at the time the prior plan was discontinued and replaced by the succeeding carrier's plan.(3) For health insurance coverage as defined in Section 38-71-840, in the case of an individual who was totally disabled at the time the prior plan was discontinued and replaced by a group health plan with similar benefits, and in the case in which subsection (1) requires an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier must be the applicable level of benefits of the succeeding carrier's plan. This benefit may be reduced by any benefits paid by the prior plan.(4) In the case of a preexisting conditions limitation included in the succeeding carrier's plan, the level of benefits applicable to preexisting conditions of persons becoming covered by the succeeding carrier's plan in accordance with this subsection (m) during the period of time this limitation applies under the new plan must be the lesser of:(A) the benefits of the new plan determined without application of the preexisting conditions limitation; and(B) the benefits of the prior plan.(5) The succeeding carrier, in applying any deductibles, coinsurance amounts applicable to the out-of-pocket maximums or waiting periods in its plan, shall give credit for the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the same or similar provisions under a prior plan providing similar benefits. In the case of deductible provisions or coinsurance amounts applicable to the out-of-pocket maximums, the credit must apply for the same or overlapping benefit periods and must be given for expenses actually incurred and applied against the deductible provisions or to the out-of-pocket maximums of the prior carrier's plan during the ninety days preceding the effective date of the succeeding carrier's plan but only to the extent these expenses are recognized under the terms of the succeeding carrier's plan and are subject to similar deductible or coinsurance provisions.(6) In any situation where a determination of the prior carrier's benefit is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information sufficient to permit verification of the benefit determination or the determination itself by the succeeding carrier. For the purposes of this section, benefits of the prior plan are determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination must be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier.HISTORY: Former 1976 Code § 38-35-941 [1985 Act No. 131, § 1] recodified as § 38-71-760 by 1987 Act No. 155, § 1; 1991 Act No. 131, §§ 8, 9; 2002 Act No. 228, § 9, eff 90 days after approval by the Governor (approved May 1, 2002).
SECTION  38-71-770. Mandatory continuation privileges.A group policy issued for delivery or renewed in this State which provides hospital, surgical, or major medical expense insurance, or any combination of these coverages, on an expense incurred basis must provide that an employee or member who has been insured continuously under the group policy for at least six months whose insurance under the group policy has been terminated for any reason other than nonpayment of the required contribution is entitled to continue coverage under the group policy for the fractional policy month remaining at termination plus six additional policy months. A group policy is considered to be a successor policy within the meaning of this section if the effective date of the coverage provided by it is sixty-two days or less after the date of termination of coverage of the prior carrier. The employee or member is not entitled to have his coverage continued if the employee or member was entitled under federal law to continuation of his coverage for a period of greater duration than provided by this section. Continuation of coverage is subject to the group policy or a successor policy remaining in force and the employee paying the entire group premium, including any portion usually paid by the former employer, before the date each month that the group policy month begins. Policies which provide benefits for other than hospital, surgical, major medical, or which provide benefits for specific diseases or accidental injuries only are not affected by this section.A notification of the privilege to continue coverage after termination must be included in each certificate of coverage. In addition, the employer shall clearly and meaningfully advise an employee upon termination of the right to continue insurance and shall advise the employee of the amount of premium required and of the employee's responsibility to pay the premium each month before the date that the policy month begins. An employee is not entitled to continue coverage under the group if eligible for other group coverage which provides similar benefits nor if the person is eligible for medicare benefits provided by Title XVIII of the United States Social Security Act or of any successor acts. Any benefits, except extended benefits payable by the policy during the period of continuation, are considered secondary to benefits under any other group health policy that is in force on a person insured through this continuation privilege.HISTORY: Former 1976 Code § 38-35-946 [1978 Act No. 547, 1979 Act No. 149 § 1] recodified as § 38-71-770 by 1987 Act No. 155, § 1; 1989 Act No. 127, § 9; 1991 Act No. 131, § 10.

Dependent child; medically necessary leave of absence.(A) As used in this section:(1) "Dependent child" means a beneficiary under a policy or certificate of coverage who:(a) is a dependent child, under the terms of the coverage, of a participant or beneficiary under the coverage; and(b) was enrolled in the coverage, on the basis of being a student at a postsecondary educational institution immediately before the first date of the medically necessary leave of absence involved.(2) "Health insurance coverage" means as defined in Section 38-71-840(14).(3) "Health insurance issuer" or "issuer" means an entity that provides health insurance coverage in this State as defined in Section 38-71-840(16).(4) "Medically necessary leave of absence" means a leave of absence of a dependent child from a postsecondary educational institution, including an institution of higher education as defined in Section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, or any other change in enrollment of the child at such an institution, that:(a) commences while the child is suffering from a serious illness or injury;(b) is medically necessary; and(c) causes the child to lose student status for purposes of coverage under the terms of the policy or certificate of coverage.(5) "State health plan" means the employee and retiree insurance program provided for in Article 5, Chapter 11, Title 1.(B) This section applies to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, including the state health plan, that is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this State and which provides health insurance coverage in the group market.(C)(1) In the case of a dependent child, a health insurance issuer may not terminate health insurance coverage of the child due to a medically necessary leave of absence before the date that is the earlier of:(a) one year after the first day of the medically necessary leave of absence; or(b) the date on which the coverage would otherwise terminate under the terms of the policy or certificate of coverage.(2) The provisions of this subsection apply to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer only if the issuer has received written certification by a treating physician of the dependent child that states the child is suffering from a serious illness or injury and that the leave of absence or other change of enrollment is medically necessary.(D) Each health insurance issuer shall include with a notice regarding a requirement for certification of student status for coverage under the policy or coverage in a plain-language description of the terms of this section for continued coverage during medically necessary leaves of absence.(E) A dependent child whose benefits are continued under this section is entitled to the same benefits during the medically necessary leave of absence as if the child continued to be a covered student at the institution of higher education and was not on a medically necessary leave of absence.(F) Coverage of the dependent child shall continue for the remainder of the period of the medically necessary leave of absence under the changed coverage in the same manner as it would have under the previous coverage in the case where:(1) a dependent child is in a period of health insurance coverage pursuant to a medically necessary leave of absence;(2) the manner in which the participant or beneficiary is covered under the policy or certificate of coverage changes, whether through a change in health insurance coverage or health insurance issuer, a change from self-insured coverage to health insurance coverage, or otherwise; and(3) the coverage as changed continues to provide coverage of dependent children.HISTORY: 2010 Act No. 217, § 3, eff June 7, 2010.
SECTION  38-71-840.

The plan of operation shall become effective upon written approval by the director.(E) If the board fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within one hundred eighty days after its appointment, the director shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate a temporary plan of operation. The director shall amend or rescind any plan adopted under this subsection at the time a plan of operation is submitted by the board and approved by the director.(F) The plan of operation shall:(1) establish procedures for handling and accounting of program assets and monies and for an annual fiscal reporting to the director;(2) establish procedures for selecting a licensed administrator, as provided in Sections 38-51-10 through 38-51-60, and setting forth the powers and duties of the licensed administrator;(3) establish procedures for reinsuring risks in accordance with the provisions of this section;(4) establish procedures for collecting assessments from reinsuring insurers to fund claims and administrative expenses incurred or estimated to be incurred by the program;(5) establish a methodology for applying the dollar thresholds contained in this section in the case of insurers that pay or reimburse health care providers though capitation or salary; and(6) provide for any additional matters necessary for the implementation and administration of the program.(G) The program shall have the general powers and authority granted under the laws of this State to insurance companies and health maintenance organizations licensed to transact business, except the power to issue health insurance plans directly to either groups or individuals. In addition, the program shall have the specific authority to:(1) enter into contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this article, including the authority, with the approval of the director, to enter into contracts with similar programs of other states for the joint performance of common functions or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions;(2) sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any assessments and penalties for, on behalf of, or against the program or any reinsuring insurers;(3) take any legal action necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the program;(4) define the health insurance plans for which reinsurance will be provided, and to issue reinsurance policies, in accordance with the requirements of this article;(5) establish rules, conditions, and procedures for reinsuring risks under the program;(6) establish actuarial functions as appropriate for the operation of the program;(7) assess reinsuring insurers in accordance with the provisions of subsection (K), and make advance interim assessments as may be reasonable and necessary for organizational and interim operating expenses.

Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the program not in default shall be legal investments for insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;(H) A reinsuring insurer may reinsure with the program as provided for in this subsection:(1) with respect to any health insurance plan offered by the small employer insurer to small employers, the program shall reinsure the level of coverage as defined in the plan of operation;(2) a small employer insurer may reinsure an entire employer group within sixty days of the commencement of the group's coverage under a health insurance plan;(3) a reinsuring insurer may reinsure an eligible employee or dependent within a period of sixty days following the commencement of the coverage with the small employer. A newly-eligible employee or dependent of the reinsured small employer may be reinsured within sixty days of the commencement of his coverage;(4)(a) the program shall not reimburse a reinsuring insurer with respect to the claims of a reinsured employee or dependent until the insurer has incurred an initial level of claims for such employee or dependent of five thousand dollars in a calendar year for benefits covered by the program. In addition, the reinsuring insurer shall be responsible for ten percent of the next fifty thousand dollars of benefit payments during a calendar year and the program shall reinsure the remainder. A reinsuring insurers' liability under this subparagraph shall not exceed a maximum limit of ten thousand dollars in any one calendar year with respect to any reinsured individual;(b) the board annually may adjust the initial level of claims, the coinsurance percentage, and the maximum limit to be retained by the insurer with the approval of the director.(5) a small employer insurer may terminate reinsurance with the program for one or more of the reinsured employees or dependents of a small employer on any anniversary of the health insurance plan;(6) a reinsuring insurer shall apply all managed care and claims handling techniques, including utilization review, individual case management, preferred provider provisions, and other managed care provisions or methods of operation consistently with respect to reinsured and nonreinsured business.(I)(1) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall establish a methodology for determining premium rates to be charged by the program for reinsuring small employers and individuals pursuant to this section. The methodology must contain a provision surcharging the reinsurance premium rate of a small employer insurer which does not employ effective cost containment and managed care arrangements including, but not limited to:(a) preferred provider organizations;(b) utilization review;(c) case management;(d) other.The methodology shall include a system for classification of small employers that reflects the types of case characteristics commonly used by small employer insurers in the State. The methodology shall provide for the development of base reinsurance premium rates which shall be multiplied by the factors set forth in item (2) to determine the premium rates for the program. The base reinsurance premium rates shall be established by the board, subject to the approval of the director, and shall be set at levels which reasonably approximate gross premiums charged to small employers by small employer insurers for health insurance plans with benefits similar to the standard health insurance plan.(2) Premiums for the program shall be as follows:(a) An entire small employer group may be reinsured for a rate that is one and one-half times the base reinsurance premium rate for the group established pursuant to this paragraph.(b) An eligible employee or dependent may be reinsured for a rate that is five times the base reinsurance premium rate for the individual established pursuant to this paragraph.(3) The board periodically shall review the methodology established under item (1), including the system of classification and any rating factors, to assure that it reasonably reflects the claims experience of the program. The board may propose changes to the methodology which shall be subject to the approval of the director.(J) If a health insurance plan for a small employer is entirely or partially reinsured with the program, the premium charged to the small employer for any rating period for the coverage issued shall meet the requirements relating to premium rates set forth in Section 38-71-910, et seq.(K)(1) Before March first of each year, the board shall determine and report to the director the program net loss for the previous calendar year, including administrative expenses and incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses.(2) Any net loss for the year shall be recouped by assessments of reinsuring insurers.(a) The board shall establish, as part of the plan of operation, a formula by which to make assessments against reinsuring insurers. The assessment formula shall be based on:(i) each reinsuring insurer's share of the total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers; and(ii) each reinsuring insurer's share of the premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from newly-issued health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery during the calendar year to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers.(b) The formula established pursuant to subitem (a) shall not result in any reinsuring insurer having an assessment share that is less than fifty percent nor more than one hundred fifty percent of an amount which is based on the proportion of the reinsuring insurer's total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers to the total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by all reinsuring insurers.(c) The board may, with approval of the director, change the assessment formula established pursuant to subitem (a) from time to time as appropriate. The board may provide for the shares of the assessment base attributable to total premium and to the previous year's premium to vary during a transition period.(d) Subject to the approval of the director, the board shall make an adjustment to the assessment formula for reinsuring insurers that are approved health maintenance organizations which are federally qualified under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300, et seq., to the extent, if any, that restrictions are placed on them that are not imposed on other small employer insurers.(3)(a) Before March first of each year, the board shall determine and file with the director an estimate of the assessments needed to fund the losses incurred by the program in the previous calendar year.(b) If the board determines that the assessments needed to fund the losses incurred by the program in the previous calendar year will exceed the amount specified in subitem (c), the board shall evaluate the operation of the program and report its findings, including any recommendations for changes to the plan of operation, to the director within ninety days following the end of the calendar year in which the losses were incurred. The evaluation shall include an estimate of future assessments and consideration of the administrative costs of the program, the appropriateness of the premiums charged, the level of insurer retention under the program, and the costs of coverage for small employers. If the board fails to file a report with the director within ninety days following the end of the applicable calendar year, the director may evaluate the operations of the program and implement such amendments to the plan of operation the director considers necessary to reduce future losses and assessments.(c) For any calendar year, the amount specified in this subparagraph is five percent of total premiums earned in the previous calendar year from health insurance plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this State by reinsuring insurers.(4) If assessments exceed net losses of the program, the excess shall be held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce program premiums. As used in this item, "future losses" includes reserves for incurred but not reported claims.(5) Each reinsuring insurer's proportion of the assessment shall be determined annually by the board based on annual statements and other reports considered necessary by the board and filed by the reinsuring insurers with the board.(6) The plan of operation shall provide for the imposition of an interest penalty for late payment of assessments.(7) A reinsuring insurer may seek from the director a deferment from all or part of an assessment imposed by the board. The director may defer all or part of the assessment of a reinsuring insurer if the director determines that the payment of the assessment would place the reinsuring insurer in a financially impaired condition. If all or part of an assessment against a reinsuring insurer is deferred, the amount deferred shall be assessed against the other participating insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessment set forth in this subsection. The reinsuring insurer receiving the deferment shall remain liable to the program for the amount deferred and shall be prohibited from reinsuring any individuals or groups with the program until such time as it pays the assessments.(L) Neither the participation in the program as reinsuring insurers, the establishment of rates, forms, or procedures, nor any other joint or collective action required by this article shall be the basis of any legal action, criminal or civil liability, or penalty against the program or any of its reinsuring insurers either jointly or separately.(M) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall develop standards setting forth the manner and levels of compensation, if any, to be paid to agents for the sale of basic and standard health insurance plans. In establishing such standards, the board shall take into consideration the need to assure the broad availability of coverages, the objectives of the program, the time and effort expended in placing the coverage, the need to provide on-going service to the small employer, the levels of compensation currently used in the industry, and the overall costs of coverage to small employers selecting these plans.(N) The program shall be exempt from any and all taxes.HISTORY: 1994 Act No. 339, § 11; 1997 Act No. 5, § 15; 2006 Act No. 332, § 7, eff June 1, 2006.

The committee also shall design a basic health insurance plan and a standard health insurance plan which contain benefit and cost-sharing levels that are consistent with the basic method of operation and the benefit plans of health maintenance organizations, including any restrictions imposed by federal law.(1) The plans recommended by the committee may include cost containment features such as:(a) utilization review of health care services, including review of medical necessity of hospital and physician services;(b) case management;(c) selective contracting with hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers;(d) reasonable benefit differentials applicable to providers that participate or do not participate in arrangements using restricted network provisions; and(e) other managed care provisions.(2) The committee shall submit the health insurance plans described in paragraphs (A) and (B) to the director for approval by January 1, 1995. If, for any reason, the committee does not provide the director with a recommendation as to the form and level of coverages to be made available pursuant to this article, the board shall make such recommendation to the director. If, subsequent to the approval of the benefit levels of the basic and standard health insurance plans, amendments to the plans become necessary, the board shall make such recommendations to the director for his approval.HISTORY: 1994 Act No. 339, § 12.

South Carolina Law > South Carolina Code of Laws
The South Carolina Legislative Council is offering access to the South Carolina Code of Laws on the Internet as a service to the public. The South Carolina Code on the General Assembly's website is now current through the 2023 Session of the General Assembly. The Code of Laws on this website will be updated online periodically; however, the official version of the Code of Laws remains the print version which will continue to be updated on a yearly basis before the start of each legislative session. The South Carolina Code, consisting only of Code text, numbering, history, and Effect of Amendment, Editor's, and Code Commissioner's notes may be copied from this website at the reader's expense and effort without need for permission.
The Legislative Council is unable to assist users of this service with legal questions. Also, legislative staff cannot respond to requests for legal advice or the application of the law to specific facts. Therefore, to understand and protect your legal rights, you should consult your own private lawyer regarding all legal questions.
While every effort was made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the South Carolina Code available on the South Carolina General Assembly's website, this version of the South Carolina Code is not official, and the state agencies preparing this website and the General Assembly are not responsible for any errors or omissions which may occur in these files. Only the current published volumes of the South Carolina Code of Laws Annotated and any pertinent acts and joint resolutions contain the official version.
Please note that the Legislative Council is not able to respond to individual inquiries regarding research or the features, format, or use of this website. However, you may notify the Legislative Services Agency at LSA@scstatehouse.gov regarding any apparent errors or omissions in content of Code sections on this website, in which case LSA will relay the information to appropriate staff members of the South Carolina Legislative Council for investigation.
