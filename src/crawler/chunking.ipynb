      "School personnel should consider the age and maturity of  students in responding to allegations of sexual harassment. When determining  whether a young child has committed sexual harassment, it is important for  teachers and school administrators to use good judgment and common sense.\n",
      "Example  1: On one occasion, a first-grade student kisses  another first-grade student on the cheek in the playground. This behavior does  not constitute sexual harassment.\n",
      "Example 2: On numerous occasions over a period of several  months, a fifth-grade student inappropriately touches another fifth-grade  student and makes overtly sexual comments and gestures to that student.

Title IX does not address discrimination or  other issues related to sexual orientation.\n",
      "Example  1: Throughout football season, a male member of the  high school football team makes unwelcome sexual advances toward another member  of the football team, who is a homosexual male. As a result, the victim quits  the football team. This conduct is sexual in nature, unwelcome, and has denied  the victim the ability to participate on the school football team. This is  sexual harassment covered by Title  IX.\n",

Even if these comments are unwelcome and  deny the student’s ability to benefit from or participate in the school’s  education program, the conduct is not sexual, and this is not sexual harassment  covered by Title  IX.\n",

       "'Here is the example of people\\'s experience of getting harassed: - \\n    \"A leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94 in my country published by so called \\x93experienced\\x94 psychotherapists contains a lot of pernicious gender stereotypes. The reason why I despair about living in my country is that girls get stereotyped as behaving one way and boys get stereotyped as behaving the opposite way, even when in reality there is a lot of overlap of behaviours between the sexes! In the leaflet, girls are automatically assumed to be \\x93vulnerable\\x94 and in need of \\x93empowering\\x94. This is kind of offensive and degrading to many young women who are capable and self sufficient. Some women do not view themselves as \\x93helpless victims\\x94, but instead as highly capable survivors! Calling girls \\x93vulnerable\\x94 or fragile doesn\\x92t help them deal with stuff in an adaptive or a resilient way. While it is true that some young women struggle with issues around eating (please don\\x92t use the pathologising words \\x93eating disorder\\x94 because it is society\\x92s expectations around food that are disordered, not the young women themselves). Once again, the fact that many young men also engage in anorexic or bulimic behaviours is conveniently ignored by the leaflet. This is sexist because young men are under pressure by the media too. Young men are pressurised to be lean and muscular by society and this cannot be ignored! In the leaflet, girls are called \\x93over conscientious and perfectionistic daughters\\x94. Seriously? What is wrong with doing things thoroughly and properly? Do people want girls to slap-dash and half finish tasks? Would you want an airline pilot who didn\\x92t do safety checks before take-off, a doctor who prescribed you the wrong drug or a nuclear power plant worker who was not conscientious? I mean come on, some jobs require stringent \\x93perfectionism\\x94 or you get fired or sued because a slap-dash attitude would cost lives! In Chemistry Class, I had to titrate chemicals according to strict concentration values in solution. If I measured the mass of chemicals wrong or used the wrong volume of distilled water, the experiment would not work and the results would have been useless. I had to also be thorough when writing up lab reports because marks would be deducted from my final grade if I was not. It is fantastic to aim for perfection because it meant that I obtained maximum marks possible for the planning part of the Chemistry Coursework. Nothing beats getting 100% marks on a task, it is truly an awesome feeling! So no, I don\\x92t think that girls should be denied the opportunity to excel by people who call them \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94. Heck, what this world so desperately needs is more high achieving young women! Even TV competitions such as \\x93dress making\\x94 or \\x93bake off\\x94 require precise measurements and the right amount of ingredients for the clothes to actually fit or cakes not to explode in the oven respectively. Lots of women take part in these shows and do well. Please, instead of pathologising girls and young women for their hard work and diligence, praise them for it! Give credit where credit is due for crying out loud! I do sense that in my country there is a culture of anti intellectualism and dare I say it, people are jealous of young women\\x92s achievements, so some teachers, parents and \\x93professionals\\x94 tell girls that they are \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94 or \\x93over contentious\\x94 because I don\\x92t know they are envious of the female youth today? My grandmother liked to do things thoroughly and properly as part of her job. She would be rolling in her grave now if she heard that young women are actively being discouraged from being conscientious and doing a thorough job by \\x93well meaning adults\\x94. In some Asian countries, such effort and thoroughness by women would be praised and actively encouraged. I am amazed at how young women and men are encouraged to strive to do the best the can and aim for high standards in some Asian countries. The toys, the games, the TV shows, everything encourage people to try hard and improve themselves. Young women in some Asian countries are told that perfection is a virtue that they should strive for. While this has the unfortunate effect of some Asian women wanting plastic surgery, it does mean that Asian women are lauded for the \\x93perfection\\x94 of the hard work that they do in intellectual pursuits. In the leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94, boys are unfairly stereotyped as all being \\x93laid back \\x91do it all at the last minute\\x92 lads\\x94. I have seen some boys spend hours researching in the library weeks in advance of a deadline. Lots of these young men were boys of Asian origin, but there were definitely some white Caucasian boys and all other ethnicities of boys studying hard too! This is why it is sexist and unfair to label the entire male gender as \\x93laid back\\x94 and lazy in this way. Sometimes being \\x93laid back\\x94 isn\\x92t lazy at all! Sometimes one needs time to mull over and consider all options carefully before reaching a decision. Some people like to look at the \\x93big picture\\x94 of the situation before they focus on the details. I have also met sone \\x93laid back last minute\\x94 girls who were high achievers! Fun fact: a close female friend of mine had a habit of leaving her homework until the night before it was due. Despite her procrastination, she always ended up getting A grades. Explain that then \\x93psychology experts\\x94! Oh wait\\x85you can\\x92t\\x85 I have also met some very lazy, unconscientious girls who often didn\\x92t submit their homework at all! Some girls really are bored and disengaged with school as the \\x93Lauren Cooper\\x94 \\x93Am I bovvered?\\x94 sketches sadly parody. This leaflet is part of the problem, not part of the solution. If you stereotype males as lazy and disengaged with studying, it may become a self fulfilling prophesy because some adults had low expectations of them! Wouldn\\x92t it be better instead to encourage everyone to be thorough, aim for high standards and do their best regardless of whether they are female, male or other? Just sayin\\x92\\x85 \"\\n    Can you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in california, \\n    considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the california State\\'s Title IX specific resolution.'"

Reporting: The individual who has experienced the harassment or discrimination should report it to the appropriate Title IX coordinator or other designated personnel at their school or workplace as soon as possible.\\n2. Investigation: Once a report is made, the institution is required to conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations.\\n3. Remedial Action: If the investigation finds that harassment or discrimination has occurred, the institution must take prompt and effective action to remedy the situation.\\n4. Retaliation: The institution is prohibited from retaliating against the individual who reported the harassment or discrimination.\\n5. Training: The institution should provide regular training to students, faculty, and staff on Title IX policies and procedures and the importance of creating a safe and inclusive learning or working environment.\\n6. Record-keeping: The institution is required to maintain records of all reports, investigations, and remedial actions taken under Title IX for at least seven years.\\n7. Confidentiality: Reports and investigations should be conducted in a confidential manner with appropriate privacy protections in place for all parties involved.\\n8. Timely Response: The institution is required to respond to all reports of harassment or discrimination in a timely manner, typically within 30 days of receiving the report.\\n9. Communication: The individual who reported the harassment or discrimination should be kept informed throughout the investigation and remedial action process with regular updates on progress being made.\\n10. Support Services: The institution must provide appropriate support services to the affected individual, such as counseling, academic accommodations, or disability services, to help them cope with the impact of the harassment or discrimination.\\n\\nThese steps are designed to ensure a safe and inclusive learning or working environment for all individuals, regardless of gender, in California institutions receiving federal funding.

In other circumstances, harassing\\nconduct will be on the basis of sex if the student would not have been affected\\nby it in the same way or to the same extent had he or she been a member of\\nthe opposite sex; e.g., pornography and sexually explicit jokes in a mostly\\nmale shop class are likely to affect the few girls in the class more than it\\nIn yet other circumstances, the conduct will be on the basis of sex in that\\nthe student's sex was a factor in or affected the nature of the harasser's\\nconduct or both.

In determining\\nwhether harassment is actionable, both Davis and the Department tell schools\\nto look at the \"constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,\\nand relationships\" (526 U.S. At 651 (citing Oncale )), and the Davis Court\\ncited approvingly to the underlying core factors described in the 1997 guidance\\nfor evaluating the context of the harassment.\\n1560, 1564-65, 1575 (N.D.

       "EvaluationResult(query='Here is the example of people\\'s experience of getting harassed: - \\n    \"A leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94 in my country published by so called \\x93experienced\\x94 psychotherapists contains a lot of pernicious gender stereotypes. The reason why I despair about living in my country is that girls get stereotyped as behaving one way and boys get stereotyped as behaving the opposite way, even when in reality there is a lot of overlap of behaviours between the sexes! In the leaflet, girls are automatically assumed to be \\x93vulnerable\\x94 and in need of \\x93empowering\\x94. This is kind of offensive and degrading to many young women who are capable and self sufficient. Some women do not view themselves as \\x93helpless victims\\x94, but instead as highly capable survivors! Calling girls \\x93vulnerable\\x94 or fragile doesn\\x92t help them deal with stuff in an adaptive or a resilient way. While it is true that some young women struggle with issues around eating (please don\\x92t use the pathologising words \\x93eating disorder\\x94 because it is society\\x92s expectations around food that are disordered, not the young women themselves). Once again, the fact that many young men also engage in anorexic or bulimic behaviours is conveniently ignored by the leaflet. This is sexist because young men are under pressure by the media too. Young men are pressurised to be lean and muscular by society and this cannot be ignored! In the leaflet, girls are called \\x93over conscientious and perfectionistic daughters\\x94. Seriously? What is wrong with doing things thoroughly and properly? Do people want girls to slap-dash and half finish tasks? Would you want an airline pilot who didn\\x92t do safety checks before take-off, a doctor who prescribed you the wrong drug or a nuclear power plant worker who was not conscientious? I mean come on, some jobs require stringent \\x93perfectionism\\x94 or you get fired or sued because a slap-dash attitude would cost lives! In Chemistry Class, I had to titrate chemicals according to strict concentration values in solution. If I measured the mass of chemicals wrong or used the wrong volume of distilled water, the experiment would not work and the results would have been useless. I had to also be thorough when writing up lab reports because marks would be deducted from my final grade if I was not. It is fantastic to aim for perfection because it meant that I obtained maximum marks possible for the planning part of the Chemistry Coursework. Nothing beats getting 100% marks on a task, it is truly an awesome feeling! So no, I don\\x92t think that girls should be denied the opportunity to excel by people who call them \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94. Heck, what this world so desperately needs is more high achieving young women! Even TV competitions such as \\x93dress making\\x94 or \\x93bake off\\x94 require precise measurements and the right amount of ingredients for the clothes to actually fit or cakes not to explode in the oven respectively. Lots of women take part in these shows and do well. Please, instead of pathologising girls and young women for their hard work and diligence, praise them for it! Give credit where credit is due for crying out loud! I do sense that in my country there is a culture of anti intellectualism and dare I say it, people are jealous of young women\\x92s achievements, so some teachers, parents and \\x93professionals\\x94 tell girls that they are \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94 or \\x93over contentious\\x94 because I don\\x92t know they are envious of the female youth today? My grandmother liked to do things thoroughly and properly as part of her job. She would be rolling in her grave now if she heard that young women are actively being discouraged from being conscientious and doing a thorough job by \\x93well meaning adults\\x94. In some Asian countries, such effort and thoroughness by women would be praised and actively encouraged. I am amazed at how young women and men are encouraged to strive to do the best the can and aim for high standards in some Asian countries. The toys, the games, the TV shows, everything encourage people to try hard and improve themselves. Young women in some Asian countries are told that perfection is a virtue that they should strive for. While this has the unfortunate effect of some Asian women wanting plastic surgery, it does mean that Asian women are lauded for the \\x93perfection\\x94 of the hard work that they do in intellectual pursuits. In the leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94, boys are unfairly stereotyped as all being \\x93laid back \\x91do it all at the last minute\\x92 lads\\x94. I have seen some boys spend hours researching in the library weeks in advance of a deadline. Lots of these young men were boys of Asian origin, but there were definitely some white Caucasian boys and all other ethnicities of boys studying hard too! This is why it is sexist and unfair to label the entire male gender as \\x93laid back\\x94 and lazy in this way. Sometimes being \\x93laid back\\x94 isn\\x92t lazy at all! Sometimes one needs time to mull over and consider all options carefully before reaching a decision. Some people like to look at the \\x93big picture\\x94 of the situation before they focus on the details. I have also met sone \\x93laid back last minute\\x94 girls who were high achievers! Fun fact: a close female friend of mine had a habit of leaving her homework until the night before it was due. Despite her procrastination, she always ended up getting A grades. Explain that then \\x93psychology experts\\x94! Oh wait\\x85you can\\x92t\\x85 I have also met some very lazy, unconscientious girls who often didn\\x92t submit their homework at all! Some girls really are bored and disengaged with school as the \\x93Lauren Cooper\\x94 \\x93Am I bovvered?\\x94 sketches sadly parody. This leaflet is part of the problem, not part of the solution. If you stereotype males as lazy and disengaged with studying, it may become a self fulfilling prophesy because some adults had low expectations of them! Wouldn\\x92t it be better instead to encourage everyone to be thorough, aim for high standards and do their best regardless of whether they are female, male or other?

       "'Here is the example of people\\'s experience of getting harassed: - \\n    \"A leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94 in my country published by so called \\x93experienced\\x94 psychotherapists contains a lot of pernicious gender stereotypes. The reason why I despair about living in my country is that girls get stereotyped as behaving one way and boys get stereotyped as behaving the opposite way, even when in reality there is a lot of overlap of behaviours between the sexes! In the leaflet, girls are automatically assumed to be \\x93vulnerable\\x94 and in need of \\x93empowering\\x94. This is kind of offensive and degrading to many young women who are capable and self sufficient. Some women do not view themselves as \\x93helpless victims\\x94, but instead as highly capable survivors! Calling girls \\x93vulnerable\\x94 or fragile doesn\\x92t help them deal with stuff in an adaptive or a resilient way. While it is true that some young women struggle with issues around eating (please don\\x92t use the pathologising words \\x93eating disorder\\x94 because it is society\\x92s expectations around food that are disordered, not the young women themselves). Once again, the fact that many young men also engage in anorexic or bulimic behaviours is conveniently ignored by the leaflet. This is sexist because young men are under pressure by the media too. Young men are pressurised to be lean and muscular by society and this cannot be ignored! In the leaflet, girls are called \\x93over conscientious and perfectionistic daughters\\x94. Seriously? What is wrong with doing things thoroughly and properly? Do people want girls to slap-dash and half finish tasks? Would you want an airline pilot who didn\\x92t do safety checks before take-off, a doctor who prescribed you the wrong drug or a nuclear power plant worker who was not conscientious? I mean come on, some jobs require stringent \\x93perfectionism\\x94 or you get fired or sued because a slap-dash attitude would cost lives! In Chemistry Class, I had to titrate chemicals according to strict concentration values in solution. If I measured the mass of chemicals wrong or used the wrong volume of distilled water, the experiment would not work and the results would have been useless. I had to also be thorough when writing up lab reports because marks would be deducted from my final grade if I was not. It is fantastic to aim for perfection because it meant that I obtained maximum marks possible for the planning part of the Chemistry Coursework. Nothing beats getting 100% marks on a task, it is truly an awesome feeling! So no, I don\\x92t think that girls should be denied the opportunity to excel by people who call them \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94. Heck, what this world so desperately needs is more high achieving young women! Even TV competitions such as \\x93dress making\\x94 or \\x93bake off\\x94 require precise measurements and the right amount of ingredients for the clothes to actually fit or cakes not to explode in the oven respectively. Lots of women take part in these shows and do well. Please, instead of pathologising girls and young women for their hard work and diligence, praise them for it! Give credit where credit is due for crying out loud! I do sense that in my country there is a culture of anti intellectualism and dare I say it, people are jealous of young women\\x92s achievements, so some teachers, parents and \\x93professionals\\x94 tell girls that they are \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94 or \\x93over contentious\\x94 because I don\\x92t know they are envious of the female youth today? My grandmother liked to do things thoroughly and properly as part of her job. She would be rolling in her grave now if she heard that young women are actively being discouraged from being conscientious and doing a thorough job by \\x93well meaning adults\\x94. In some Asian countries, such effort and thoroughness by women would be praised and actively encouraged. I am amazed at how young women and men are encouraged to strive to do the best the can and aim for high standards in some Asian countries. The toys, the games, the TV shows, everything encourage people to try hard and improve themselves. Young women in some Asian countries are told that perfection is a virtue that they should strive for. While this has the unfortunate effect of some Asian women wanting plastic surgery, it does mean that Asian women are lauded for the \\x93perfection\\x94 of the hard work that they do in intellectual pursuits. In the leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94, boys are unfairly stereotyped as all being \\x93laid back \\x91do it all at the last minute\\x92 lads\\x94. I have seen some boys spend hours researching in the library weeks in advance of a deadline. Lots of these young men were boys of Asian origin, but there were definitely some white Caucasian boys and all other ethnicities of boys studying hard too! This is why it is sexist and unfair to label the entire male gender as \\x93laid back\\x94 and lazy in this way. Sometimes being \\x93laid back\\x94 isn\\x92t lazy at all! Sometimes one needs time to mull over and consider all options carefully before reaching a decision. Some people like to look at the \\x93big picture\\x94 of the situation before they focus on the details. I have also met sone \\x93laid back last minute\\x94 girls who were high achievers! Fun fact: a close female friend of mine had a habit of leaving her homework until the night before it was due. Despite her procrastination, she always ended up getting A grades. Explain that then \\x93psychology experts\\x94! Oh wait\\x85you can\\x92t\\x85 I have also met some very lazy, unconscientious girls who often didn\\x92t submit their homework at all! Some girls really are bored and disengaged with school as the \\x93Lauren Cooper\\x94 \\x93Am I bovvered?\\x94 sketches sadly parody. This leaflet is part of the problem, not part of the solution. If you stereotype males as lazy and disengaged with studying, it may become a self fulfilling prophesy because some adults had low expectations of them! Wouldn\\x92t it be better instead to encourage everyone to be thorough, aim for high standards and do their best regardless of whether they are female, male or other? Just sayin\\x92\\x85 \"\\n    Can you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in california, \\n    considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the california State\\'s Title IX specific resolution.'"

Both the Court\\'s and the Department\\'s definitions are contextual\\ndescriptions intended to capture the same concept - that under Title IX, the\\nconduct must be sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student\\'s\\nability to participate in or benefit from the school\\'s program. In determining\\nwhether harassment is actionable, both Davis and the Department tell schools\\nto look at the \"constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,\\nand relationships\" (526 U.S. At 651 (citing Oncale )), and the Davis Court\\ncited approvingly to the underlying core factors described in the 1997 guidance\\nfor evaluating the context of the harassment.',\n",

The law applies to all aspects of education, including academic programs, extracurricular activities, and employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual harassment, which includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, is a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The law requires that schools respond to incidents of sexual harassment in a manner that ensures that the victim feels safe and supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the scenario you provided, the professor's behavior could be considered sexual harassment under Title IX, as it involves unwelcome sexual advances made by a professor to a student. The law requires schools to take prompt and effective action to address incidents of sexual harassment, including disciplinary action against the perpetrator if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that academic discourse, even if it is offensive or controversial, is protected by the First Amendment and cannot be prohibited under Title IX. However, if the professor's behavior creates a hostile environment for students or violates other school policies, the school may take action to address the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to responding to incidents of sexual harassment, schools must also provide training and education to students, faculty, and staff on issues related to sexual harassment and assault. This can help create a culture of respect and inclusivity on campus and promote a safe and supportive learning environment for all students. 0.0\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "The guidance provides several examples of gender-based harassment that may be covered under Title IX, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sex stereotyping: This refers to when a student is harassed based on their failure to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations. For example, if a young woman is teased or mocked for not being feminine enough, or if a young man is teased or mocked for not being masculine enough, this could be considered gender-based harassment.\n",
      "2. Hostile environment: This refers to when a student experiences harassment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. For example, if a student is repeatedly subjected to sexually charged comments or gestures in a classroom or school hallway, this could create a hostile environment.\n",
      "3. Quid pro quo harassment: This refers to when a student is harassed in exchange for something of value, such as a better grade or a favor. For example, if a teacher repeatedly asks a male student for sexual favors in exchange for a higher grade, this could be considered quid pro quo harassment.\n",
      "4. Sexual assault: This refers to when a student is physically touched or attacked in a sexual manner without their consent. For example, if a student is sexually assaulted by another student or staff member, this could be considered sexual harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In determining whether harassment is covered under Title IX, the guidance considers several factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The identity of and relationship between the alleged harasser and the subject or subjects of the harassment.\n",
      "2. The number of individuals involved in the harassment.\n",
      "3. The nature of the harassment (e.g., verbal, physical, sexual).\n",
      "4. The extent to which the harassment is directed at students of both sexes or is based on sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guidance also notes that harassment can occur in a variety of settings, including in classrooms, school hallways, and during extracurricular activities. It emphasizes that harassment is not limited to physical contact or words, but can also include nonverbal behaviors or gestures. 0.0\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "The response provided is YES. The California State's Title IX specific resolution for the scenario described in the query is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information given, it seems that the affected individual did not feel comfortable bringing the situation directly to her supervisor or human resources division since she was obligated to provide customer service at her workplace. However, according to Title IX, any \"person\" is protected from sex discrimination, including male and female students. If the harassment is based on sex, it can be seen as a violation of Title IX, regardless of the gender of the harasser or the person being harassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query describes instances of unwelcome physical touching that created a hostile work environment based on sex. According to Title IX protection extends to all people, regardless of their sex or sexual orientation. Depending on the circumstances, harassment can be considered sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX if it is sufficiently serious to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query also references the Supreme Court's ruling in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., which held that sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment can violate Title VII's prohibition against discrimination because of sex. This decision is consistent with OCR policy, originally stated in its 1997 guidance, that Title IX prohibits sexual harassment regardless of the gender of the harasser or the person being harassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of this information, it appears that the affected individual has grounds for a Title IX claim against the school for failing to address the hostile work environment created by the unwelcome physical touching. 1.0\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "YES. The response provided answers the question in line with the context information provided, and it is consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., et al, which established that same-sex sexual harassment can constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII. Additionally, the response highlights that Title IX protects any \"person\" from sex discrimination, and that both male and female students are protected from sexual harassment engaged in by a school's employees, other students, or third parties. The response also notes that gender-based harassment, including harassment predicated on sex stereotyping, is covered by Title IX if it is sufficiently serious to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program. 1.0\n",

On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\\x92t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\\x92s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \\x93CoventGardenWomen\\x94. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \\x93we get her point, she can stop complaining now\\x94. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\\x92s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\\x92t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\\x92s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\\x92t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\\x92s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn\\x92t exist. \"\\n    Can you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in california, \\n    considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

The reason why I despair about living in my country is that girls get stereotyped as behaving one way and boys get stereotyped as behaving the opposite way, even when in reality there is a lot of overlap of behaviours between the sexes! In the leaflet, girls are automatically assumed to be \\x93vulnerable\\x94 and in need of \\x93empowering\\x94. This is kind of offensive and degrading to many young women who are capable and self sufficient. Some women do not view themselves as \\x93helpless victims\\x94, but instead as highly capable survivors! Calling girls \\x93vulnerable\\x94 or fragile doesn\\x92t help them deal with stuff in an adaptive or a resilient way. While it is true that some young women struggle with issues around eating (please don\\x92t use the pathologising words \\x93eating disorder\\x94 because it is society\\x92s expectations around food that are disordered, not the young women themselves). Once again, the fact that many young men also engage in anorexic or bulimic behaviours is conveniently ignored by the leaflet. This is sexist because young men are under pressure by the media too. Young men are pressurised to be lean and muscular by society and this cannot be ignored! In the leaflet, girls are called \\x93over conscientious and perfectionistic daughters\\x94. Seriously? What is wrong with doing things thoroughly and properly? Do people want girls to slap-dash and half finish tasks? Would you want an airline pilot who didn\\x92t do safety checks before take-off, a doctor who prescribed you the wrong drug or a nuclear power plant worker who was not conscientious? I mean come on, some jobs require stringent \\x93perfectionism\\x94 or you get fired or sued because a slap-dash attitude would cost lives! In Chemistry Class, I had to titrate chemicals according to strict concentration values in solution. If I measured the mass of chemicals wrong or used the wrong volume of distilled water, the experiment would not work and the results would have been useless. I had to also be thorough when writing up lab reports because marks would be deducted from my final grade if I was not. It is fantastic to aim for perfection because it meant that I obtained maximum marks possible for the planning part of the Chemistry Coursework. Nothing beats getting 100% marks on a task, it is truly an awesome feeling! So no, I don\\x92t think that girls should be denied the opportunity to excel by people who call them \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94. Heck, what this world so desperately needs is more high achieving young women! Even TV competitions such as \\x93dress making\\x94 or \\x93bake off\\x94 require precise measurements and the right amount of ingredients for the clothes to actually fit or cakes not to explode in the oven respectively. Lots of women take part in these shows and do well. Please, instead of pathologising girls and young women for their hard work and diligence, praise them for it! Give credit where credit is due for crying out loud! I do sense that in my country there is a culture of anti intellectualism and dare I say it, people are jealous of young women\\x92s achievements, so some teachers, parents and \\x93professionals\\x94 tell girls that they are \\x93too perfectionistic\\x94 or \\x93over contentious\\x94 because I don\\x92t know they are envious of the female youth today? My grandmother liked to do things thoroughly and properly as part of her job. She would be rolling in her grave now if she heard that young women are actively being discouraged from being conscientious and doing a thorough job by \\x93well meaning adults\\x94. In some Asian countries, such effort and thoroughness by women would be praised and actively encouraged. I am amazed at how young women and men are encouraged to strive to do the best the can and aim for high standards in some Asian countries. The toys, the games, the TV shows, everything encourage people to try hard and improve themselves. Young women in some Asian countries are told that perfection is a virtue that they should strive for. While this has the unfortunate effect of some Asian women wanting plastic surgery, it does mean that Asian women are lauded for the \\x93perfection\\x94 of the hard work that they do in intellectual pursuits. In the leaflet about \\x93supporting teenagers\\x94, boys are unfairly stereotyped as all being \\x93laid back \\x91do it all at the last minute\\x92 lads\\x94. I have seen some boys spend hours researching in the library weeks in advance of a deadline. Lots of these young men were boys of Asian origin, but there were definitely some white Caucasian boys and all other ethnicities of boys studying hard too! This is why it is sexist and unfair to label the entire male gender as \\x93laid back\\x94 and lazy in this way. Sometimes being \\x93laid back\\x94 isn\\x92t lazy at all! Sometimes one needs time to mull over and consider all options carefully before reaching a decision. Some people like to look at the \\x93big picture\\x94 of the situation before they focus on the details. I have also met sone \\x93laid back last minute\\x94 girls who were high achievers! Fun fact: a close female friend of mine had a habit of leaving her homework until the night before it was due. Despite her procrastination, she always ended up getting A grades. Explain that then \\x93psychology experts\\x94! Oh wait\\x85you can\\x92t\\x85 I have also met some very lazy, unconscientious girls who often didn\\x92t submit their homework at all! Some girls really are bored and disengaged with school as the \\x93Lauren Cooper\\x94 \\x93Am I bovvered?\\x94 sketches sadly parody. This leaflet is part of the problem, not part of the solution. If you stereotype males as lazy and disengaged with studying, it may become a self fulfilling prophesy because some adults had low expectations of them! Wouldn\\x92t it be better instead to encourage everyone to be thorough, aim for high standards and do their best regardless of whether they are female, male or other? Just sayin\\x92\\x85 \"\\n    Can you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in california, \\n    considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the california state specific resolution.', contexts=None, response=\" In response to the experience shared and the query for a resolution under Title IX implementation in California regarding gender-based harassment, it is important to clarify that both sexual and non-sexual (but gender-based) harassment should be addressed together when determining if a hostile environment exists. The standard for evaluating harassment under Title IX is contextual and based on the severity of the conduct, its persistence or pervasiveness, and its effect on a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the education program.\\n\\nIn this scenario, the leaflet containing gender stereotypes can be considered problematic if it creates an environment that denies or limits students' abilities to participate in or benefit from the educational program based on their sex. The leaflet may create a hostile or abusive educational environment for girls by reinforcing harmful stereotypes and limiting their perceived capabilities.\\n\\nTo address this issue, the school or university should take the following steps:\\n\\n1. Educate students, faculty, and staff about gender stereotyping and its negative impact on individuals and the community as a whole. Provide workshops, seminars, or training sessions to promote understanding and awareness.\\n2. Establish clear policies prohibiting gender-based harassment and discrimination in all forms, including sex stereotyping. Make sure these policies are communicated effectively to students, faculty, and staff.\\n3. Encourage an inclusive and respectful campus culture that values diverse experiences and backgrounds. Foster open dialogue and provide resources for students who face discrimination or harassment.\\n4. Regularly assess the campus climate through student surveys, focus groups, and other methods to identify any ongoing issues related to gender stereotyping or harassment. Use this information to inform policy improvements and targeted interventions.\\n5. Investigate incidents of gender-based harassment thoroughly and fairly, using a process that is consistent with Title IX regulations. Ensure that the investigation is conducted in a timely manner and that all parties involved are treated with respect and dignity throughout the process.\\n6. Provide remedies for students who have experienced gender-based harassment or discrimination, such as counseling services, academic support, or disciplinary action against the offending party.\\n7. Regularly review and update your school's Title IX policies and procedures to ensure they are effective in addressing gender stereotyping and other forms of gender-based harassment.\", passing=None, feedback=\"1.
