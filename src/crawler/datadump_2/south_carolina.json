[{"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"When I was 17, I worked in a clothing store that sold both mens and womens clothing, as well as some unisex items. I was working overtime in the evening, around 8.30pm during the winter so it was already dark. I was by myself on the shop floor as my manager was cashing up in the stock room, when a man in his late 50s/early 60s came in and started asking about the winter boots we had on special offer. We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said \u0093Whilst you\u0092re down there, why don\u0092t you take one for the team?\u0094. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn\u0092t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just \u0091ignore it and don\u0092t get upset by it\u0092! Even when I think about it now, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in south_carolina, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn\u0092t exist. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in south_carolina, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the south_carolina state specific resolution.", "Response": " In light of the experience shared and assuming this situation unfolds within an educational institution or a workplace in South Carolina, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 comes into play as it prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and workplaces receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nFirst, the individual who has experienced harassment or discrimination should report the incident to their institution's Title IX coordinator or Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office if it occurred in a workplace setting. The report can be made verbally, in writing, or through an anonymous reporting system, and the individual is protected from retaliation for filing a complaint.\n\nUpon receiving the report, the Title IX coordinator or EEO office will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. They will interview all relevant parties involved, collect evidence, and assess whether there has been a violation of Title IX. The individual who reported the incident will be informed of the outcome of the investigation and any actions taken as a result.\n\nIf the investigation reveals that harassment or discrimination occurred, the institution or employer is required to take prompt and effective remedial measures to eliminate the hostile environment and prevent any recurrence. This may include disciplinary action against the perpetrator, providing counseling or other supportive services for the affected individual, and implementing training programs to educate the community on Title IX compliance and respectful behavior.\n\nIt is important to note that the individual's right to file a complaint with law enforcement and pursue criminal charges should not be discouraged, as Title IX addresses discrimination and harassment separately from criminal laws. If you or someone else has experienced sexism, sexual harassment, or assault in South Carolina, report it to both your institution or workplace and local law enforcement to ensure the greatest chance of a safe and supportive environment for all individuals."}, {"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"I read pages and pages of this website and it made me sick in my stomach\u0085 When I was working as a library assistant in an almost all-female environment I never felt threatened: it was so different from what happens in all-male workplaces where a female employee is the odd one out\u0085 I do remember being approached by an adult male when I was about thirteen or fourteen and was playing an arcade computer game after school in the city centre: he got closer and closer behind me, and there was nobody around so I tried to ignore him and shifted forward. I just wanted to enjoy the game and had never experienced this He then got so close that his body was starting to press against mine.. I never looked back or said anything..I realised that something was horribly wrong and walked away from him, and out of the arcade hall\u0085 It was bright outside, the city bustling with people and I quickened my pace, looking behind me\u0085 I climbed onto a bus and thought that everyone around me knew, that they could see what had happened\u0085 I felt dirty, and disgusted\u0085 I understood then what girls were experiencing, the reality of what a lot of women deal with, the emotions that go through you when a stranger targets you for unwanted sexual contact\u0085 I am disgusted to see that twenty-five years on I still see the same attitudes from men, condoning this kind of behaviour\u0085I can walk down the street at night or any time of day without fearing sexual comments or assault, whereas all the accounts in this blog show that it is never the same for women\u0085 As an ethnically different man living in the UK (the incident in my teens happened in my home country) I get people in cars and vans shouting unintelligible things at me \u0096 always men \u0096 and that always makes me feel victimised, because although I cannot hear the words I can sense that they are meant to diminish me. I want to say this: sexual harassment and violence is not a \u0091women\u0092s issue\u0092, because men are responsible for it, therefore it is a men\u0092s issue, our issue.

I want to ask any man reading my post a question: have you ever had the urge to touch a female colleague, waitress, stranger (etc.) inappropriately, or to make suggestive remarks to her? If any man thinks that it is harmless, he should read this blog and realise the impact it has on women at the receiving end, how horrified, belittled, disgusted, and powerless it makes them feel\u0085 I hope more men will join me in stamping out harassment of this kind and taking a stand to make it a thing of the past. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in south_carolina, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

While the context provided does not explicitly mention a university or workplace setting in South Carolina, I will assume for the sake of answering the query that such a setting could be implied from the experiences shared.\n\nAccording to the Title IX Implementation in South Carolina as outlined in the context information, harassment and stalking are defined as patterns of unwanted words or conduct that serve no legitimate purpose and cause mental or emotional distress or fear for safety. Harassment can occur in person or electronically.\n\nThe individual shared an experience of being followed and approached by a man when they were younger, which made them feel uncomfortable and powerless. In this scenario, the behavior described could be considered harassment under South Carolina law, as it was unwanted and served no legitimate purpose. The individual also expressed concern about men's attitudes towards women and the impact of sexual harassment and violence on them.\n\nTo address these concerns in a university or workplace setting in South Carolina, the following steps could be taken:\n\n1. Reporting: Encourage individuals to report incidents of harassment or discrimination to their supervisors, human resources departments, or campus security personnel as soon as possible.

Education: Provide regular training and awareness programs to students, faculty, and staff on Title IX policies, sexual harassment, and discrimination. These programs should cover topics such as recognizing harassment, reporting procedures, and the importance of creating a safe and inclusive learning and working environment.\n3. Enforcement: Ensure that there are clear consequences for individuals who engage in harassing behavior, including disciplinary action up to and including expulsion or termination.
