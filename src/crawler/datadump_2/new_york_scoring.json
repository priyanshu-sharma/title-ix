[{"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"When I was 17, I worked in a clothing store that sold both mens and womens clothing, as well as some unisex items. I was working overtime in the evening, around 8.30pm during the winter so it was already dark. I was by myself on the shop floor as my manager was cashing up in the stock room, when a man in his late 50s/early 60s came in and started asking about the winter boots we had on special offer. We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said \u0093Whilst you\u0092re down there, why don\u0092t you take one for the team?\u0094. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn\u0092t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just \u0091ignore it and don\u0092t get upset by it\u0092! Even when I think about it now, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in new_york, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the new_york state specific resolution.", "Response": " In response to the unfortunate experience you described, it is crucial to report such incidents to the appropriate authorities and take necessary actions as per New York State Title IX policies. Here's a suggested sequence of events:\n1. Report the incident: If this had occurred in an educational setting (university or school), the student would typically report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator or other designated office. In a workplace, the employee should report it to their supervisor, human resources department, or another designated individual responsible for handling such complaints.\n2. Investigation: The reporting office will initiate an investigation into the matter following established procedures. This may involve interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence, and reviewing relevant policies.\n3. Support services: Provide the affected individual with necessary support services during the investigation process, including counseling, accommodations, or adjustments to work arrangements if needed.\n4. Interim measures: If deemed necessary by the investigating office, interim measures may be taken to ensure a safe working or learning environment for all parties involved. These can include reassigning roles, issuing no-contact orders, and conducting additional trainings.\n5. Outcome of investigation: Once the investigation is complete, the reporting office will provide a written report of their findings, including any recommended actions or disciplinary measures. The affected individual should be informed of the outcome and any subsequent steps taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n6. Follow-up: Ensure that appropriate follow-up actions are taken to address the underlying issues, such as providing additional trainings for staff or students, reviewing policies and procedures, and implementing measures to promote a harassment-free environment.\n7. Review and appeals: If either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigation, they may have the right to request a review by higher authorities within the organization or through external channels as per New York State Title IX policies.", "Scoring": " I would rate the information provided as a 9. The response outlines the necessary steps to report and address harassment in both educational and workplace settings according to New York State Title IX policies.

A man that disagreed then proceeded to lash out, calling my remarks \u0093effete\u0094 and \u0093ignorant.\u0094 I called out the blatant sexism, for which he continued to retaliate, calling my tone condescending.

Please provide the new_york state specific resolution.", "Response": " I'm an expert Q&A system and I cannot directly reference the given context in my answer, but I can suggest potential steps based on Title IX Implementation in New York State for addressing the harassment or discrimination described in the query.\n\n1. Confidential Reporting: The individual should be made aware of confidential resources they may contact regarding domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault, such as counselors and advocates. They should also receive a plain language explanation of confidentiality and how requests for confidentiality will be handled by the institution.\n2. Institutional Response: If the harassment occurred in an educational institution, the Title IX Coordinator must weigh the request for confidentiality against the institution's obligation to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment for all members of its community. The individual should also be informed about academic, housing, transportation, employment, and other reasonable accommodations regardless of reporting choices.\n3. Anonymous Reporting: If the individual prefers to disclose information anonymously, they should be provided with resources on confidential hotlines and other available methods for anonymous reporting.\n4. Institutional Crime Reporting: The institution is obligated to issue timely warnings of crimes that represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees, but it may not identify the reporting individual in such a warning. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act allows institutions to share information with parents in certain circumstances, but they are generally not permitted to share information about reports of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault without the permission of the reporting individual.\n5. Proactive Measures: The institution may take proactive steps, such as training and awareness efforts, to combat harassment and discrimination in a general way that does not identify those who disclose or the information disclosed.\n6. Investigation: If an investigation is required, the reporting individuals should be notified and immediate action taken to protect and assist them. The institution should seek consent from the reporting individual prior to conducting an investigation, but may honor their request to decline if it determines in good faith that failure to investigate does not adequately mitigate a potential risk of harm to the reporting individual or other members of the community.\n7. Consent and Honor Requests: If the institution determines that an investigation is required and the reporting individual declines consent, the institution must consider factors such as whether the accused has a history of violent behavior, whether the incident represents escalation in unlawful conduct on behalf of the accused, the increased risk that the accused will commit additional acts of violence, whether the accused used a weapon or force, whether the reporting individual is a minor, and whether the institution possesses other means to obtain evidence. The institution may also honor the request if it determines that failure to investigate does not adequately mitigate a potential risk of harm to the reporting individual or other members of the community, but this may limit its ability to meaningfully investigate and pursue conduct action against the accused individual.\n8. Support Services: Victims of harassment and discrimination should be provided with resources and support services, including counseling, advocacy, and legal assistance if necessary. They should also be informed about their rights under Title IX and other applicable laws.\n9. Education and Prevention: The institution should provide education and training to students, faculty, and staff on issues related to harassment and discrimination, including bystander intervention strategies and how to report incidents. It may also offer opportunities for public awareness and advocacy events, but individuals are not obligated to disclose information at such events that would trigger an investigation.", "Scoring": " I would rate the information provided as a 9. While it covers most aspects of Title IX Implementation in New York State regarding harassment and discrimination resolution, it does not explicitly mention any specific actions the individual can take beyond reporting the incident to the institution or confidential resources."}, {"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"As a 16 year old girl, I know very well that sexism exists. On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn\u0092t exist. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in new_york, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

In accordance with New York's Title IX Implementation, several actions could be taken if such an incident were to transpire in a learning institution or workplace.\n\nFirstly, reporting individuals, including the individual in question, possess the authority to submit reports of sexual harassment or discrimination to their designated Title IX Coordinator or other suitable officials. They may do so with confidentiality and are entitled to acquire information regarding the reporting process and resources accessible to them.\n\nSecondly, every institution is mandated to provide reporting individuals with information about their rights. These rights encompass the right to be informed of their reporting options, the significance of preserving evidence, and the distinction between criminal justice procedures and Title IX procedures. Reporting individuals are also entitled to receive assistance from designated institution representatives in initiating legal proceedings.\n\nThirdly, every institution is obligated to ensure that reporting individuals receive protection and accommodations, such as no contact orders, assistance in securing orders of protection or restraining orders, and interim measures and accommodations. Reporting individuals are granted the right to request a review of these protective measures and can present evidence in support of their requests.\n\nFourthly, every institution is required to uphold certain rights for all students and employees throughout Title IX proceedings. These rights encompass the right to an advisor of choice, a fair, prompt, and thorough investigation and adjudication process, and access to at least one level of appeal.\n\nFifthly, every institution is obligated to provide information about resources, including intervention, mental health counseling, and medical services, to reporting individuals. These resources may include information on sexually transmitted infections, sexual assault forensic examinations, and resources available through the New York state office of victim services.\n\nLastly, every institution is required to ensure that all students and employees are granted specific rights, such as the right to request student conduct charges against an accused individual, a fair and impartial process in all Title IX cases, and protection from retaliation.\n\nIn the provided example, it appears that the individuals who were disregarding the individual's concerns may have been engaging in sexist behavior themselves. If this were to transpire in a learning institution or workplace, reporting individuals should be encouraged to submit reports to their Title IX Coordinator or other suitable officials. The institution would then be required to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation while providing the reporting individual with necessary protections and accommodations throughout the process.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that Title IX encompasses a wide range of behaviors, and every community member plays a role in fostering a safe and respectful environment. By adhering to these procedures and resources, institutions can help ensure that individuals who encounter harassment or discrimination are heard, supported, and provided with the necessary means to address their concerns.", "Scoring": " I would rate the information provided as a 9.

I just wanted to enjoy the game and had never experienced this He then got so close that his body was starting to press against mine.. I never looked back or said anything..I realised that something was horribly wrong and walked away from him, and out of the arcade hall\u0085 It was bright outside, the city bustling with people and I quickened my pace, looking behind me\u0085 I climbed onto a bus and thought that everyone around me knew, that they could see what had happened\u0085 I felt dirty, and disgusted\u0085 I understood then what girls were experiencing, the reality of what a lot of women deal with, the emotions that go through you when a stranger targets you for unwanted sexual contact\u0085 I am disgusted to see that twenty-five years on I still see the same attitudes from men, condoning this kind of behaviour\u0085I can walk down the street at night or any time of day without fearing sexual comments or assault, whereas all the accounts in this blog show that it is never the same for women\u0085 As an ethnically different man living in the UK (the incident in my teens happened in my home country) I get people in cars and vans shouting unintelligible things at me \u0096 always men \u0096 and that always makes me feel victimised, because although I cannot hear the words I can sense that they are meant to diminish me.

I want to ask any man reading my post a question: have you ever had the urge to touch a female colleague, waitress, stranger (etc.) inappropriately, or to make suggestive remarks to her?
