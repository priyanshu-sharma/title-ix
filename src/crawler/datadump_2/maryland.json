[{"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"When I was 17, I worked in a clothing store that sold both mens and womens clothing, as well as some unisex items. I was working overtime in the evening, around 8.30pm during the winter so it was already dark. I was by myself on the shop floor as my manager was cashing up in the stock room, when a man in his late 50s/early 60s came in and started asking about the winter boots we had on special offer. We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said \u0093Whilst you\u0092re down there, why don\u0092t you take one for the team?\u0094. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn\u0092t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just \u0091ignore it and don\u0092t get upset by it\u0092! Even when I think about it now, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in maryland, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

Part of my PhD requires public engagement via social media. In one such recent Twitter encounter, I stated my opinion and backed it up with facts. A man that disagreed then proceeded to lash out, calling my remarks \u0093effete\u0094 and \u0093ignorant.\u0094 I called out the blatant sexism, for which he continued to retaliate, calling my tone condescending.

On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn\u0092t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone\u0092s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk \u0093CoventGardenWomen\u0094. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because \u0093we get her point, she can stop complaining now\u0094. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there\u0092s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn\u0092t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it\u0092s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don\u0092t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it\u0092s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn\u0092t exist. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in maryland, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace.

I just wanted to enjoy the game and had never experienced this He then got so close that his body was starting to press against mine.. I never looked back or said anything..I realised that something was horribly wrong and walked away from him, and out of the arcade hall\u0085 It was bright outside, the city bustling with people and I quickened my pace, looking behind me\u0085 I climbed onto a bus and thought that everyone around me knew, that they could see what had happened\u0085 I felt dirty, and disgusted\u0085 I understood then what girls were experiencing, the reality of what a lot of women deal with, the emotions that go through you when a stranger targets you for unwanted sexual contact\u0085 I am disgusted to see that twenty-five years on I still see the same attitudes from men, condoning this kind of behaviour\u0085I can walk down the street at night or any time of day without fearing sexual comments or assault, whereas all the accounts in this blog show that it is never the same for women\u0085 As an ethnically different man living in the UK (the incident in my teens happened in my home country) I get people in cars and vans shouting unintelligible things at me \u0096 always men \u0096 and that always makes me feel victimised, because although I cannot hear the words I can sense that they are meant to diminish me. I want to say this: sexual harassment and violence is not a \u0091women\u0092s issue\u0092, because men are responsible for it, therefore it is a men\u0092s issue, our issue. I want to try harder to change things, and I want to be brave (or I hope to be) and challenge sexism when I see it\u0085 I am horrified by what I read in this blog and I want to say this: we, men, can do better, so much better than this. I want to ask any man reading my post a question: have you ever had the urge to touch a female colleague, waitress, stranger (etc.) inappropriately, or to make suggestive remarks to her? If any man thinks that it is harmless, he should read this blog and realise the impact it has on women at the receiving end, how horrified, belittled, disgusted, and powerless it makes them feel\u0085 I hope more men will join me in stamping out harassment of this kind and taking a stand to make it a thing of the past. \" \nCan you plan and provide the resolution of above harassment/discrimination based on Title IX Implementation in maryland, considering that the same case happened in some univerity or in some workspace. Please provide the maryland state specific resolution.", "Response": " The individual's experiences described in their testimony highlight instances of sexual harassment and unwanted advances towards women, as well as ethnic discrimination against men. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational institutions receiving federal funding, including sexual harassment. Maryland State has laws in place to address employment discrimination based on sex, gender, and ethnicity under the Maryland Fair Employment Practices Act (MFEPA).\n\nFor cases related to education, the resolution would involve reporting the incident to the Title IX coordinator at the respective educational institution. The university is required by law to investigate all reported incidents of sexual harassment promptly and thoroughly. If the investigation confirms that sexual harassment occurred, appropriate remedial actions must be taken, including disciplinary measures against the harasser if they are an employee or student. The Title IX coordinator can provide resources and support services for both the complainant and the respondent.\n\nFor cases related to employment in Maryland, the individual should file a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Human Rights (MCCR) within six months of the alleged incident using either their online form or by submitting it via mail or fax. The MCCR is responsible for investigating charges of unlawful discrimination based on sex, gender, and ethnicity in employment. If MCCR finds that discrimination occurred, they may issue a notice of right to sue, allowing the individual to file a civil lawsuit against their employer. In some cases, the MCCR may attempt to mediate a resolution between the parties before filing a lawsuit.\n\nIt's essential to create a culture where everyone feels safe and respected, regardless of gender or ethnicity. Encouraging open communication, education on Title IX policies, and offering support services for victims are vital steps in preventing and addressing harassment and discrimination."}, {"Question": "Here is the example of people's experience of getting harassed: - \n\"I worked in a doggie daycare for two years as the front desk manager.
