The Utah House of Representatives is comprised of 75 men and women, representing every area of the state, elected to two-year terms. The Utah Legislature meets annually in a General Session, convening in mid-January and adjourning “sine die” after 45 calendar days (not including President’s Day). Special Sessions may be called at any time during the year either by the Governor or by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature.
The Utah Legislature is a civilian-run form of government, meaning legislators not only serve their constituents at the Capitol, but are also business people, farmers and ranchers, teachers, lawyers, stay-at-home parents, and more. Each brings a unique background and perspective, all sharing the common goal of making Utah the best state to live, work, learn, and play.
On the first day of the beginning of each term (two years), the House elects a presiding officer, known as the Speaker of the House. Speaker Brad Wilson (R) of Kaysville has served in this position since November 2018. The House Majority and Minority caucuses also elect members to serve in leadership positions including Majority/Minority Leader and Whip.
The Utah House of Representatives, drawing on the diverse backgrounds and expertise of its members, identifies and leads on critical issues and best ideas in public policy. We honor our pioneer legacy by taking the long view. At the end of our service, we will leave the institution stronger; the State more financially stable; our education systems more nimble, forward-thinking, and responsive to the needs of both students and employers; our healthcare more innovative and affordable; our infrastructure better suited to meet the opportunities of tomorrow; our natural resources—air, water, and incomparable public lands—all better off, protected and preserved to enhance the quality of life for all Utahns. We are proud to represent our constituents and proud to call Utah home.

A WELCOME MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT STUART ADAMS
Welcome to the website of the Utah Senate! In Utah, elected officials strive to be close to the individuals they serve. We believe it is the best way to create policy that is truly for the people.
The Utah Senate consists of 29 senators who each bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the Legislature. As part-time policymakers, many of us hold day jobs that range from working in the healthcare industry to business to teaching in schools.
The Legislature meets annually for the 45-day general session each January to deliberate and vote on legislation. During the remaining months of the year, we spend time listening to our constituents and working on legislation for the next session.
We value and understand the need for those outside the legislative body to contribute to legislation. As we debate and consider policy, we encourage input from all Utahns. Constituent input allows us to create the best policies for our state.
It is an honor to serve Utah as a state legislator, and I hope you will use this website as a resource to connect with senators and engage in the legislative process.

About the Senate
The Utah Territory was established by an act of Congress on Monday, September 9, 1850 which provided for a territorial government made up of a territorial governor chosen every four years, a territorial Assembly with a 13-member council chosen every second year and a 26-member House of Representatives chosen annually, and a territorial Judiciary made up of a Supreme Court, District Courts, Probate Courts, and justices of the peace. The creation of the Territory of Utah was part of the Compromise of 1850 seeking to preserve the political balance of power between the slave and free states.
Following the organization of the territory, Brigham Young was inaugurated as its first governor on Sunday, February 9, 1851 and the first territorial assembly met Monday, September 22, 1851. The legislative body of the Utah Territory continued to act until 1896 with the successful passage of the Utah Constitution and Utah achieving statehood. The first President of the Utah Territorial Senate was Willard Richards and the first Territorial Speaker of the House was William Wines Phelps. In 1870, the length of a Representative’s term was extended to two years, and in 1896 the Utah Territorial Council became the Utah Senate with a four-year term.
The Utah Constitution assigns legislative power to a part-time citizen legislature that meets each year, beginning in January and ending in March. When the legislative session adjourns, senators return home to their homes, families, and regular occupations to live under the laws they created.
Senators occupations include attorneys, businessmen, businesswomen, bankers, educators, an engineer, CPAs, homemakers, a pharmacist, a nurse, a doctor, a dentist, an orthodontist and former university president.
The political makeup of the Utah Senate is about 80 percent Republican and 20 percent Democrat.
Do you want to serve? The State Constitution outlines the qualifications to become a senator:
A resident of the district from which they are elected for six months
Senators are elected to four-year terms, with roughly half the Senate standing for election every two years.
