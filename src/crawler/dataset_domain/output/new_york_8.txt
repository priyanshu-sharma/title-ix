Title IX: Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination
Title IX: Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. Title IX provides, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The DOE is committed to complying with Title IX and ensuring that DOE schools and workplaces are free of sex discrimination.In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Education adopted new regulations which revise the definition of sexual harassment prohibited under Title IX, and also create new procedures for investigating allegations of sexual harassment covered by Title IX. The USDOE is now in the process of reviewing those 2020 regulations. Pending further federal directives, the DOE Overview of Title IX Investigations & Notice of Rights is a resource for staff, students, and parents.Additional information about the 2020 regulations can be found here: US Department of Education Title IX page.Staff, students, and parents should also continue to refer to Chancellor's Regulations A-831 and A-832 (which set forth the NYCDOE’s policy for prohibiting student-to-student sexual harassment and student-to-student discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and/or bullying), and Chancellor's Regulation A-830 (which sets forth the DOE's Anti-Discrimination Policy, including for staff sexual harassment). Complaints that allege conduct prohibited under Title IX will be investigated at the school level (under Chancellor’s Regulation A-831 or A-832) or by OEO (under Chancellor’s Regulation A-830), and separately by the DOE’s Title IX team.”If you have any questions regarding the new regulations or DOE policy, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at Title_IX_Inquiries@schools.nyc.gov.Who is protected by Title IX?Title IX’s protections apply to DOE students, parents, staff members, and applicants for employment.How do I file a Title IX complaint?To file a Title IX complaint, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at:Title IX Coordinator110 William Street – 15th FloorNew York, NY 10038718-935-4987Title_IX_Inquiries@schools.nyc.govK-12 Students Bill of Rights and Responsibilities The Student Bill of Rights serves as a guide for students as they strive to become productive citizens in a diverse society.Discrimination, and Sexual and Other Harassment, Against Students or EmployeesChancellor’s Regulation A-830 is the DOE’s Non-Discrimination Policy and outlines how to file a complaint of staff-to-student or staff-to-staff discrimination, including to allege discrimination based on gender (including gender identity and/or gender expression) or sexual orientation.

If you believe your school, college, or university has violated Title IX, learn more about how to file a complaint with the Department’s Office for Civil Rights. Technical assistance inquiries, including questions regarding compliance with the new Title IX Rule, may be submitted to: OCR@ed.gov.
Sexual harassment under Title IX includes – dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking.
Survivors are in the position of control to decide what happens after an incident of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, occurs.
Schools must respect a survivor’s decision to file, or not to file, a formal complaint and must offer supportive measures either way.
Schools must respond promptly in every instance by offering to provide supportive measures like dorm reassignments or class schedule adjustments
Schools are forbidden from pressuring a survivor into filing or not filing a formal complaint or participating in a grievance process.
To protect younger students, K-12 schools must respond promptly when any school employee has notice of sexual harassment, including sexual assault.
The regulation extends to all aspects of a school’s education program or activity and applies to any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by a college or university.
If a survivor chooses to participate in a grievance process, the regulation protects survivors from inappropriately being asked about prior sexual history (also known as “rape shield” protections), and the survivor must not be required to divulge any medical, psychological, or similarly privileged records.
A survivor never has to come face-to-face with the accused during a hearing, and an accused is never allowed to personally ask questions of a survivor.
Survivors are protected against retaliation when they choose to report sexual misconduct or not, file a formal complaint or not, participate in a grievance process or not.
Survivors are protected against bullying or harassment throughout the grievance process.
The regulation provides students with a right to written notice of allegations, the right to an advocate, and the right to submit, examine, and challenge evidence.
All students have the right to a live hearing where advisors conduct cross-examination.
All students have the right to an impartial finding based on evidence using a standard of evidence — either the preponderance of evidence standard or the clear and convincing standard — that applies to all members of the school community, including faculty.
Schools must offer both parties an equal opportunity to appeal the finding.
The regulation gives schools flexibility to conduct Title IX investigations and hearings remotely.
Workplace Gender Inclusion Guidelines
Workplace Gender Inclusion Guidelines   
Purpose  
It is the policy of the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) to provide  equal employment 
opportunities, and a welcoming and inclusive work environment free from discrimination and/or harassment , 
regardless of actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation . 
Consistent with this policy, each office and school must be proactive in creating and maintaining an 
environment that promotes respect, value s all employees , and foster s understanding of gender identity and 
expression within the workplace.   
 
These guidelines  set forth protocol s for gender inclusion and describe best practices for supporting 
transgender and gender expansive employees . These g uidelines apply to  all NYCDOE employees  and 
individuals who work with NYCDOE employees.  
 
These guidelines provide guidance for employees, but  do not anticipate every situation that may occur.  
Individual employees should contact their supervisor and/or the Office of Equal Opportunity & Diversity 
Management (OEO) Title IX Team at Title_IX_Inquiries@schools.nyc.gov  with questions.  For NYCDOE Title 
IX contact information, visit the Title IX webpage . 
 
Schools and offices should a ddress any incidents of inappropriate workplace conduct that may violate 
NYCDOE policy, or that may be inconsistent with these guidelines, in accordance with Chancellor’s Regulation 
A-830. Concerns about inappropriate student behavior toward transgender or gender expansive employees 
should be addressed consistent with Chancellor’s Regulation A -443 and the Discipline Code.  
Terminolo gy 
Transgender and gender expansive employees may use different words to describe themselves,  their lives , 
and experiences. Some examples include: trans, transgender, genderqueer, non -binary, gender fluid, two -
spirit, trans  man , and trans  woman.  The language individuals use may differ based on factors such as 
geographic location, race, ethnicity, age, country of origin, and culture, and may also change over time.  
 The individual employee determines  their own identity. Other employees, including supervisors,  must  be 
sensitive to  and use the terminology that supports and respects the individual employee’s identit y.  
 
Visit the Guidelines to Support Transgender and Gender Expansive Students  for a non -exhaustive list of such 
terminology.  
Supporting Employees  
The role of the NYCDOE is to provide support where appropriate and promote workplace inclusion.   
Employees  may discuss and express their gender openly and decide when, with whom, and how much of 
their private information t o share with others.  
 Some trans gender or gender expansive employees may be in the process of a gender transition , taking steps 
to live as their gender consistent with their gender identity . This process may or may not involve changes in 
name, pronouns, and appearance (including clothing and hairstyle). Not all transitions are binary or involve 
categories of male or female  (some employees  may be non -binary, agender, or gender expansive),  and not 
all gender  transitions involve  medical treatments such as hormone therapy or gender- affirming surgeries . In 
addition, not all transgender or gender expansive employees may be open about their gender transition, even if there are noticeable changes.   
 An employee is in charge of their gender transition , and may request support and/ or information fro m their 
supervisor, and/or  from the OEO Title IX Team . Supports  may  include, but are not limited t o:  • discussing the office or school role in supporting the employee’s  transition  and addressing questions 
and concerns ; 
• discussing practical  work life adjustments , such as  changing the employee’s information in NYCDOE 
records, benefits, and any other relevant matters;  
• reviewing available resources;  
• discussing and preparing for aspects of gender transition  at work, as appropriate,  including the timing 
of the transition, as well as  the employee ’s decision to communicate with  colle agues and/or students  
about their transition or gender ; and 
• putting in place other measures for ensuring a sensitive , inclusive work  environment.  
 
Supervisors who would like assistance in supporting their employees and creating a welcoming and inclusive 
workp lace may also contact the OEO Title IX Team .  
Names  and Pronouns   
Every employee is entitled to be addressed by the name and pronoun  of their choos ing that correspond s to 
their gender identity that they assert at their work place . Employees  are not required to obtain a court -
ordered name and/or gender change before being addressed  verbally or in writing  by the name and pronoun 
that they choose.  
 Intentionally referring to an employee , verbally or in writing,  by a pronoun inconsistent with t he employee’s 
gender identity  or by a name other than the ir chosen name is unacceptable conduct and may constitute a 
violation of Chancellor’s Regulation A -830. 
 Consistent with the NYCDOE Style Guide , employees should use gender -neutral language in writing unless 
referring to a specific person where the author already knows the gendered pronouns that the recipient uses.   
Emp loyee/Personnel  Records  
 Name Change  
Records that are part of the HR processes and systems  (including for onboarding)  are tied to the individual’s 
social security record, and therefore, must reflect the applicant’s legal name, even if the legal name is not 
the chosen first or last name. In addition, all benefits and retirement records must use the employee’s legal 
name. This includes fingerprinting, licensure, federal forms (eligibility to work), payroll and tax applications, 
and any medical records. These records can be updated only upon proof of a legal name change, as set forth below.  
 Office - and school -based systems , records , paperwork and other documents  that are not tied to the 
individual ’s social security record may be changed to reflect a chosen name  without a legal name change . If 
an employee has not legally changed their name and would like to use a chosen firs t and/or l ast name at 
work, they should:  
• log into Employee Self Service  to enter their chosen name in NYCAPS;  
o The employee’s login ID is their  Employee ID number . 
o for assistance with logging into NYCAPS ESS, please see: Employee Self -Service (NYCAPS 
ESS) .  
o from the navigation menu, click Personal Details , then  select Name . 
o under the Name  heading, click on “ Preferred Name ” and enter the chosen name.  
 
• once chosen name  (“Preferred Name ”) is entered in NYCAPS, the display name in systems tied to 
NYCAPS (e.g., Central NYCDOE email and username, google display name, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Advance, SOLAS, Open Market System (OMT), SESIS, STARS Classroom) will automatically pop ulate 
with that chosen name.  • notify their supervisor to ensure their name is affirme d in the workplace consistently;    
• update their name themselves in any of fice- or school -based systems that are not tied to  NYCAPS or  
social security record  (e.g., office o r school website, office - or school -based email, lesson plan 
systems) or request assistance from Employee Relations at OPIInfo@schools.nyc.gov  to make these 
updates, if they want their chosen name to appear in those systems  or any documents they generate;     
• request that office - or school -based documents and paperwork which are not generated from an 
updated off ice- or school -based system reflect their chosen name (e.g., list of club advisors, 
yearbook, name posted on an office door or informational materials and posters) if they want the ir 
chosen name to appear there;   
• for employee IDs issued at 65 Court Street,  email PhotoIDUnit@schools.nyc.gov  to request an 
appointment to obtain an ID with their chosen name.  Employees should speak with their supervisor 
for school- issued IDs.  
 
All legal name changes  are handled centrally through HR Connect. For an employee to update their legal 
name in NYCAPS:  
• log into Employee Self- Service (NYCAPS ESS) at nyc.gov/ess .  
• from the navigation menu, click Personal Details , then s elect Name . 
• under the Name  heading, click on the name to edit legal name. Do not select the section under 
“Preferred Name .” 
• a Legal Name  pop-up window will appear. Enter the new legal name. The name must be entered 
exactly as it appears on the employee’s S ocial Security card.  
• if the name change is approved, the employee will receive an email letting them know that their  
name change was successfully made. If the name change does not exactly match the name on record 
with the Social Security Administration, th e name change in NYCAPS will be rejected and the 
employee will receive an email letting them know that it was declined.  
 Once an employee has legally changed their name, all documents and systems tied to the Central HR and payroll system will automatically  change, including the employee’s Central NYCDOE email and username 
display name, google display name, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Advance, SOLAS, Open Market System (OMT), SESIS, STARS Classroom , and benefits. The employee must contact their retirement system separately. 
Supervisors should ensure that o ffice - and school -based systems  and documents are updated consistent with 
the legal name change.  
 
Central employees with DCAS employee IDs or other non -NYCDOE bu ilding IDs cannot be updated without a 
legal name change. These employees may contact their building manager for information on how to update 
their legal name on their ID at 1 Centre Street. School employees may update their employee ID issued at 65 Court Street (not DCAS employee IDs or other non -NYCDOE building IDs) by emailing 
PhotoIDUnit@schools.nyc.gov  to request a photo ID appointment. Employees who have legally change d their  
name for any reason will have the name history archived for legal recordkeeping and audit purposes.  
 For additional information on updating your legal name in NYCDOE records, visit HR Connect.  
 
Gender Marker  Change  
To update personal information in NYCDOE records, including gender marker  (Female or woman; Male or 
man; Non -Binary (not female/woman or male/man) ; A gender not listed above ; Unknown/I choose not to 
disclose) , an employee may do so in Employee Self Service .  Addressing Harassment and Discrimination  
Harassment and/or Discrimination: Chancellor’s Regulation A -830  
Chancellor’s Regulation A -830 contains NYCDOE’s Anti -Discrimination Policy and provides information 
regarding allegations of discrimination  or harassment  by employees . Employees  may make a re port directly 
to OEO  using the online form at  https://www.nycenet.edu/oeo  or using the other methods described in the  
regulation.  
Facilities  Accessibility  
Transgender and gender  expansive employees  must be provided access to facilities ( e.g., restrooms, locker 
rooms, changing rooms) consistent with their gender identity asserted at work.  A transgender or gender 
expansive employee  may not be required to use a single- gender  facilit y or a facility that conflicts with th eir 
gender identity asserted at work . For employees  who are gender expansive , the supervisor should work with 
the employee to facilitate access to facilities that affirm  their identity.  
 
Supervisors must try to provide reasonable alternative arrangements for any employee who expresses a need 
or desire for increased privacy. Reasonable alternative arrangements may include a single occupancy restroom . Such a lternative arrangements must be presented as one, a nd not the only, option and  never as a 
requirement . Furthermore, any arrangements must be provided in a non -stigmatizing manner that protects 
the employee’s privacy and is not marginalizing or disruptive for the employee . 
Workplace Practices   
Expectations about workplace attire must  be applied equally and in a gender -neutral manner to all 
employees .  Employees may not be prohibited from wearin g attire that confirms their gender identit y. 
 
Employees should avoid using gendered language (e.g., greeting a room of new job applicants with “good 
morning gentlemen” or “ladies”) and gendered practices (e.g., dividing employees into teams of “women” and “men” for a training activity).  
 
Notification  of Employees  
Supervisors  are responsible for ensuring that employees are familiar with these guidelines , and should 
reinforce that  transgender and gender expansive employees  are covered  by Chancellor’s Regulation A -830.
