It is the policy of the State of California that all persons, regardless  of their gender, should enjoy freedom from discrimination of any kind in the  educational institution of the state. The laws found in the
are  collectively known as the Sex Equity in Education Act. These laws expand upon gender  equity and Title IX laws which provide guidance to California’s education system.  Each Local Educational Agency (LEA) will be responsible for following the laws  in addition to Title IX requirements.
Senate Bill 1375 (California Education  Code, 221.61), creates new requirements for the Title IX coordinators’ informational  posts. Title IX coordinators should carefully read and disseminate the  following:
On or before July 1, 2017, public schools,  private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements  of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools  shall post in a prominent and conspicuous location on their Internet Web sites  all of the following:
The name and  contact information of the Title IX coordinator for that public school, private  school, school district, county office of education, or charter school, which  shall include the Title IX coordinator’s phone number and email address.
The rights of a  pupil and the public and the responsibilities of the public school, private  school, school district, county office of education, or charter school under  Title IX, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, Internet Web links  to information about those rights and responsibilities located on the Internet  Web sites of the department’s Office for Equal Opportunity and the United  States Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, and the list of rights  specified in Section 221.8.
A description of  how to file a complaint under Title IX, which shall include all of the  following:
An explanation of the statute of  limitations within which a complaint must be filed after an alleged incident of  discrimination has occurred, and how a complaint may be filed beyond the  statute of limitations.
An explanation of how the complaint will be  investigated and how the complainant may further pursue the complaint,  including, but not limited to, Internet Web links to this information on the  United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights’ Internet Web  site.
An Internet Web link to the United States  Department of Education Office for Civil Rights complaints form, and the  contact information for the office, which shall include the phone number and  email address for the office.
On or before April 1, 2017, and annually  thereafter, the Superintendent shall send a letter through electronic means to  all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject  to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education,  and charter schools informing them of the requirement specified in subdivision  (a) and of their responsibilities under Title IX.
A public school that does not maintain an  Internet Web site may comply with subdivision (a) by posting the information  specified in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a) on the  Internet Web site of its school district or county office of education.
Nothing in this section shall be construed  to require a school or local educational agency to establish an Internet Web  site if the school or local educational agency does not already maintain one.
Title  IX is a federal law that was passed in 1972 to ensure that male and female  students and employees in educational settings are treated equally and fairly.  It protects against discrimination based on sex (including sexual harassment).  In addition, Title IX protects transgender students and students who do not  conform to gender stereotypes. State law also prohibits discrimination based on  gender (sex), gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The  preamble to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 states that:
“No  person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from  participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination  under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
Title  IX requires that each school district have at least one person designated as  the Title IX Coordinator.
From the regulations  governing Title  IX of the Education Amendments of 1972
On May 6th, 2020 the U.S. Department of Education,  Office for Civil Rights (OCR), released a finalized version of the new Title IX Regulations. Amendments to Title IX became effective on August  14, 2020. Specifically, The Final Rule changes the way in which institutions  and local education agencies are required to respond to allegations of sexual  harassment. The new Title IX regulations are intended to clarify sexual  harassment as a form of sex discrimination and expand on the definition of  sexual harassment.The new Title IX regulation  can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 34 CFR Part 106 .

Education  Equity/Title IX Resources from the Feminist Majority
State  and federal law protects students from all forms of sexual harassment  (including sexual violence and sexual abuse). Any student, regardless of their  gender, may potentially face sexual harassment which can interfere with a  student’s academic performance, as well as their emotional and physical  well-being. Preventing and remedying sexual harassment in schools is essential  to ensuring a safe environment in which students can learn. Title IX  coordinators are in the best position to prevent harassment and to lessen the  harm to students if, despite their best efforts, acts of sexual harassment do  occur.
To assist coordinators  in eliminating sexual harassment from schools the United States Department of  Education Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has developed a webpage on
, which includes, but is not limited to, the following:
In 2006, new Title IX  regulations for the establishment of single sex programs in schools were  adopted by the OCR. Many  factors and legal requirements must be addressed if schools are considering the  development of single-sex options. The regulations related to single sex programs  can be found in California Education Code 221.5
Guidelines  on Title IX Requirements Related to Single-Sex Classes and Schools 2002
Dear  Colleague Letter on Single-Sex Programs and Title IX 2007
, each  public elementary, secondary, and charter school in California, that offers  competitive athletics, are required to make the following information available  to the public at the end of each school year:
The  total enrollment of the school, classified by gender.
The  number of pupils enrolled at the school who participate in competitive  athletics, classified by gender.
The  number of male and female teams, classified by sport and by competition level.
Competitive  Athletics are defined as sports where the activity has coaches, a governing  organization, practices, competes during a defined season, and has competition  as its primary goal. The required data as stated above should  reflect the total number of players on a team roster on the official first day  of competition. Schools should post the information on the school’s website. If the school does not maintain a website,  the school district or charter operator shall post the information on its  website. All materials used by the school to compile the data are to be  retained by the school for a minimum of three years after the information has  been posted.
Complaints pertaining to Title IX issues should be filed by utilizing  the Uniform Complaint Procedures (UCP) as identified in California Code of  Regulations, Title 5, Sections 4600 et. seq. For more information on the  UCP complaints and appeals visit the CDE’s Uniform  Complaint Procedures and Resolution  of Discrimination/Harassment Complaint pages.

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the Assistant Secretary finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by title IX and this part, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in the education program or activity extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless Subpart C does not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of title IX and this part to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to §106.8, or to the Assistant Secretary.

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a recipient that operates a public nonvocational elementary or secondary school that excludes from admission any students, on the basis of sex, must provide students of the excluded sex a substantially equal single-sex school or coeducational school.
(2) Exception. A nonvocational public charter school that is a single-school local educational agency under State law may be operated as a single-sex charter school without regard to the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3) Substantially equal factors. Factors the Department will consider, either individually or in the aggregate as appropriate, in determining whether schools are substantially equal include, but are not limited to, the following: The policies and criteria of admission, the educational benefits provided, including the quality, range, and content of curriculum and other services and the quality and availability of books, instructional materials, and technology, the quality and range of extracurricular offerings, the qualifications of faculty and staff, geographic accessibility, the quality, accessibility, and availability of facilities and resources, and intangible features, such as reputation of faculty.
(4) Definition. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(1) through (3) of this section, the term “school” includes a “school within a school,” which means an administratively separate school located within another school.
(b) Use of appraisal and counseling materials. A recipient which uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or use materials which permit or require different treatment of students on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.
(c) Disproportion in classes. Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.
(1) On the basis of sex, provide different amount or types of such assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance which is of any particular type or source, apply different criteria, or otherwise discriminate;
(2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person which provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner which discriminates on the basis of sex; or
(3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance which treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.
(b) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government which requires that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein; Provided, That the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
(i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
(ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
(iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.
(c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.
(2) Separate athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid for members of each sex may be provided as part of separate athletic teams for members of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph and §106.41.
(Authority: Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 U.S.C. 1681, 1682; and Sec. 844, Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93–380, 88 Stat. 484)
(a) Assistance by recipient in making available outside employment. A recipient which assists any agency, organization or person in making employment available to any of its students:
In providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner which would violate Subpart E of this part if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service which may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any recipient which provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.
(a) Status generally. A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
(b) Pregnancy and related conditions. (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.
(2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation so long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
(3) A recipient which operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
(4) A recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan or policy which such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
(5) In the case of a recipient which does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status which she held when the leave began.
(a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.
(b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of this part, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(c) Equal opportunity. A recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the Director will consider, among other factors:
Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the Assistant Secretary may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.
(d) Adjustment period. A recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from the effective date of this regulation. A recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics at the secondary or post-secondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from the effective date of this regulation.
(Authority: Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 U.S.C. 1681, 1682; and Sec. 844, Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93–380, 88 Stat. 484)
If use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in physical education classes has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have that effect.
(a) General. (1) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance.
(2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way which could adversely affect any applicant's or employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.
(3) A recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting employees or students to discrimination prohibited by this subpart, including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, and with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient.
(4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this part.
(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, consideration for and award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, application of nepotism policies, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;
(6) Granting and return from leaves of absence, leave for pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, leave for persons of either sex to care for children or dependents, or any other leave;
(8) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, selection for tuition assistance, selection for sabbaticals and leaves of absence to pursue training;
A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for any employment opportunity which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless:
(a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring. A recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or hiring of employees, or has been found to have in the past so discriminated, the recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
(b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at entities which furnish as applicants only or predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this subpart.
(b) Results in the payment of wages to employees of one sex at a rate less than that paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.
(c) Maintain or establish separate lines of progression, seniority systems, career ladders, or tenure systems for similar jobs, position descriptions, or job requirements which classify persons on the basis of sex, unless sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for the positions in question as set forth in §106.61.
(a) Fringe benefits defined. For purposes of this part, fringe benefits means: Any medical, hospital, accident, life insurance or retirement benefit, service, policy or plan, any profit-sharing or bonus plan, leave, and any other benefit or service of employment not subject to the provision of §106.54.
(1) Discriminate on the basis of sex with regard to making fringe benefits available to employees or make fringe benefits available to spouses, families, or dependents of employees differently upon the basis of the employee's sex;
(2) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a fringe benefit plan which does not provide either for equal periodic benefits for members of each sex, or for equal contributions to the plan by such recipient for members of each sex; or
(3) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a pension or retirement plan which establishes different optional or compulsory retirement ages based on sex or which otherwise discriminates in benefits on the basis of sex.
(2) Which is based upon whether an employee or applicant for employment is the head of household or principal wage earner in such employee's or applicant's family unit.
(b) Pregnancy. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude from employment any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom.
(c) Pregnancy as a temporary disability. A recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom and any temporary disability resulting therefrom as any other temporary disability for all job related purposes, including commencement, duration and extensions of leave, payment of disability income, accrual of seniority and any other benefit or service, and reinstatement, and under any fringe benefit offered to employees by virtue of employment.
(d) Pregnancy leave. In the case of a recipient which does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status which she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
(a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with this subpart is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement which imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex which are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
(b) Benefits. A recipient which provides any compensation, service, or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or benefit to members of the other sex.
A recipient shall not in any advertising related to employment indicate preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on sex unless sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for the particular job in question.
(a) Marital status. A recipient shall not make pre-employment inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for employment, including whether such applicant is “Miss or Mrs.”
(b) Sex. A recipient may make pre-employment inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for employment, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this part.
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by this subpart provided it is shown that sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section which is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  
OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS  
THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY
April 24, 2015  
 
Dear Title IX Coordinator:  
Thank you for serving as the Title IX coordinator for your school, school district, college, or 
university.  Your  work, and that of your fellow coordinators across the country , is essential to 
ensuring that all students in the United States , regardless of their sex, have an equal educati onal 
opportunity.  As a Title IX coordinator, you are an invaluable resource for every person in your 
institution’s community —including students, their parents or guardians, employees, and applicants 
for admission and employment —regarding their rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments 
of 1972 (Title IX) .1  The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) supports your 
efforts to help your institution comply with Title IX and  the Department’s implementing 
regulations ,2 and looks forw ard to working with you and your institution to provide students with 
an educational environment free from sex discrimination . 
This letter accompanies a Dear Colleague letter to your school district superintendent or college or 
university president that reminds all educational institutions receiving Federal financial assistance 
from the Department that they must designate at least one employee to coordinate their efforts to 
comply with and carry out their responsibilities under Title IX.  Th at letter explains the significance 
of your work as the Title IX coordinator to the institution’s compliance with Title IX and the 
importance of providing you with the appropriate  authority  and support necessary to perform your 
responsibilities.    
This letter also accompa nies a resource guide that may assist you  in your work as a Title IX 
coordinator.  The resource guide  first provides an overview of the scope of Title IX.  It then explains 
Title IX’s administrative requirements, which are the foundation for your  job and y our institution’s  
compliance with Title IX.  The resource guide also discusses  your institution’s obligations with 
respect to some of the key issues under Title IX and provides references to helpful F ederal 
1 20 U.S.C. §§  1681 –1688.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) shares enforcement authority over Title IX with OCR.  
2 The Department’s Title IX regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 106,  are available at 
http://www.ed.gov/ policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite -34cfr106.html .

remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 2—Letter to Title IX Coordinators  
resources.  Finally, th e resource guide discusses  your institution’s obligation to report information 
to the Department that could be relevant to Title IX  compliance .3 
To be an effective Title IX coordinator, you must have the full support of your institution.  Such 
support includes making your role as the Title IX coordinator visible in the community.  Because the 
obligation to designate a Title IX coordinator affects educational institutions of every size and at 
every educational level,  there are a variety of ways to ensure that Title IX coordinators ha ve the 
necessary support to help institutions meet their obligations under Title IX.   For more information 
about how your institution should support your work as the Title IX coordinator, please see the accompanying Dear Colleague Letter and Title IX Resou rce Guide .  
I commend you for your efforts to ensure students learn in educational environments free from discrimination , and OCR supports you in your work.  If you need technical assistance, please 
contact the OCR regional office serving your state or territory by visiting http://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/CFAPPS/OCR/contactus.cfm
 or call OCR’s Customer Service Team at 1 -
800- 421-3481; TDD 1 -800-877-8339.  
Thank you for your commitment to assist ing your institution in complying with Title IX and to 
ensuring that all your institution’s students have safe and healthy environments in which to learn and thrive.  I look forward to continuing to work with Title IX coordinators nationwide to help prevent a nd address sex discrimination in our nation’s schools.  
Sincerely,   
 /s/  
Catherine E. Lhamon  
Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  
OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS  
THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY
April 2 4, 2015  
Dear Colleague:  
I writ e to remind you that all school districts, colleges, and universities receiving Federal financial 
assistance  must designate a t least o ne employee to coordinate their efforts to comply with and 
carry out their responsibilities under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), which  
prohibits sex discrimination in education programs and activities.1  These designated employees  
are generally referred to as Title IX coordinators. 
Your Title IX coordinator plays an essential role in helping you ensure that every person affected by 
the o perations of your educational institution—i ncluding students, their parents  or guardians,  
employees, and applicants for admission and employment —is aware of the legal rights  Title IX 
affords and that your institution and  its officials comply with their leg al obligations under Title IX.  
To be effective, a  Title IX coordinator must have the full support of your institution.  It is therefore 
critical that all institutions provide their Title IX coordinators with the appropriate authority  and 
support necessary  for them to carry out their duties and use their expertise to help their 
institutions comply with Title IX. 
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX for institutions 
that receive funds from the Department  (recipie nts).2  In our enforcement work, OCR has found 
that some of the most egregious and harmful Title IX violations occur when a recipient fails to  
designate a Title IX coordinator  or when a Title IX coordinator has not been sufficiently trained or 
given the a ppropriate level of authority  to oversee the recipient’s compliance with Title IX .  By 
contrast, OCR has found that an effective Title IX coordinator often help s a recipient  provide equal 
educational opportunities to all students.   
OCR has previously issued guidance documents that include discussions of the responsibilit ies of a 
Title IX coordinator, and those documents  remain in full force.  This letter incorporates  that existing  
OCR guidance on Title IX coordinators and provides additional clarification and recommendations 
1 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(a).   Although Title IX applies to any recipient that offers education programs or activities, this letter 
focuses on Title IX coordinators designated by local educational agencies, schools, colleges, and universities.

as
 appropriate.  This letter outlines the factors a recipient should consider when designating  a Title 
IX coordinator, then describes the Title IX coordinator’s responsibilities  and authority .  Next, this  
letter reminds recipients of the importance of supporting Title IX coordinators by ensuring that the 
coordinator s are visible in the ir school communit ies and have the appropriate training .  
Also attached is a letter directed to Title IX coordinators that provides more information about 
their responsibilities  and a Title IX resource guide .  The resource guide  includes an overview of the 
scope of Title IX, a discussion about Title IX’s administrative requirements, as well as a discussion of 
other key Title IX issues and references to Feder al resources .  The discussion of each Title IX issue 
includes recommended best practices for the Title IX coordinator to help your institution  meet its 
obligations under Title IX.   The resource guide  also explains your institution’s obligation to report 
information  to the Department that could be relevant to Title IX .  The enclosed letter to Title IX 
coordinators and the resource guide may be useful for you to understand your institution’s 
obligations under Title IX.  
Designation  of a Title IX Coordinator  
Educational institutions that receive Federal financial assistance  are prohibited under Title IX  from 
subjecting any person to discrimination on the basis of sex.  Title IX authorizes the Department of 
Education to issue regulations to effectuate Title IX.3  Under those regulations , a recipient must 
designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its 
responsibilities under Title IX and the Department’s implementing regulations.4  This position may 
not be left vacant; a  recipient must have at least one person designated and actually serving as the 
Title IX coordinator at all times.  
In deciding to which senior school official the Title IX coordinator  should report and what other 
functions (if any) that person should perform , recipients are urged to consider the following :5 
A. Independence  
The Title IX coordinator’s role should be independent to avoid any potential conflicts of interest 
and the Title IX coordinator should report directly to the recipient’s senior leadership, suc h as the 
district superintendent or the college or university president.  Granting the Title IX coordinator this

http://www.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite -34cfr106.html .   
4 34 C.F.R. §  106.8(a).  
5 Many of the principles in this document also apply generally to employees required to be designated to coordinate 
compliance with other civil rights laws enforced by OCR against educational institutions, such as Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation  Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §  794; 34 C.F.R. §  104.7(a), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, 42 U.S.C. §§  12131 –12134; 28 C.F.R. §  35.107(a).                                                        Page 3—Dear Colleague L etter: Title IX Coordinators

i
ndependence also ensure s that seni or school officials are fully informed of any Title IX issues that 
arise and that the Title IX coordinator has the appropriate authority, both formal and informal, to 
effectively coordinate the recipient’s compliance with Title IX.   Title  IX does not categorically 
exclude particular employees from serving as Title IX coordinators.  However, when designating a 
Title IX coordinator, a recipient should be careful to avoid designating an employee whose other 
job responsibilities may create a conflict of interest.  For example, designating a disciplinary board 
member, general counsel, dean of students, superintendent,  principal, or athletics director as the 
Title IX coordinator may pose a conflict of interest.  
B. Full-Time  Title IX  Coordinator  
Designating a full -time Title IX coordinator will minimize the risk of a conflict of interest  and in 
many cases ensure sufficient time is available to perform all the role’s responsibilities .  If a recipient 
designates one employee to coordinate the recipient’s com pliance with Title IX and other related  
laws, it is critical that the employee has the qualifications , training,  authorit y, and time to address 
all complaints throughout the institution, including those raising Title IX issues.  
C. Multiple Coordinators  
Although not required by Title IX, it may be a good practice for some recipients, particularly larger school districts , college s, and universities, to designate multiple Title IX coordinators.  For example, 
some recipients have found that designating a Title IX coordinator for each building, school, or campus provides students and staff with more familiarity with the Title IX coordinator .  This  
familiarity may result in more effective training of the school community on their rights and 
obligations under Title IX and improved reporting of incidents under Title IX.  A recipient that 
designates multiple coordinators should designate  one lead Title IX coordinator who has ultimate 
oversight responsibility .  A recipient should encourage  all of its Title IX coordinators to work 
together to ensure consistent enforcement of its policies and Title IX.  
Responsibilities and Authority of a Titl e IX Coordinator  
The Title IX coordinator’s primary responsibility  is to coordinate the recipient’s compliance with 
Title IX, including the recipient’s grievance procedures for resolving Title IX complaints.   Therefore, 
the Title IX coordinator must have the authority necessary to fulfill this coordinat ion responsibility .  
The recipient must inform the Title IX coordinator of all reports and complaints raising Title IX issues, even if the complaint was initially filed with another individual or office or the investigation will be conducted by another individual or office.  The Title IX coordinator is responsible for 
coordinating the recipient’s responses to all complaints involving possible sex discrimination .  This 
responsibility includes monitor ing outcom es, identify ing and address ing any patterns,  and 
assessing  effects on the campus climate.  Such coordination can help the recipient avoid Title IX 
violations, particularly violations involving sexual harassment and violence, by preventing incidents Page 4—Dear Colleague L etter: Title IX Coordinators  
Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.
f
rom re curring or becoming systemic problems  that affect the wider school community .  Title IX 
does not specify who should determine the outcome of Title IX complaints or the actions the school 
will take in response to such complaints.   The Title IX coordinator could play this role, provided 
there are no conflicts of interest, but does not have to .   
The Title IX coordinator must have knowledge of the recipient’s policies and procedures on sex 
discrimination and should be involved in the drafting and revision of s uch policies and procedures 
to help ensure that they comply with the requirements of Title IX .  The Title IX coordinator should 
also coordinate the collection and analysis of information from an annual climate survey  if, as OCR 
recommends, the school conducts such a survey.  In addition, a recipient should provide Title IX 
coordinators with access to information regarding enrollment in particular subject areas, 
participation in athletics, administration of school discipline, and incidents of sex -based 
haras sment.  Granting Title IX coordinators the appropriate authority will allow them to identify 
and proactively address issues related to possible sex discrimination as they arise.  
Title IX makes it unlawful to retaliate against individuals —including Title IX coordinators —not just 
when they file a complaint alleging a violation of Title IX, but also when they participate in a Title IX 
investigation, hearing, or proceeding, or advocate for others’ Title IX rights .6  Title IX’s broad anti -
retaliation provision p rotects Title IX coordinator s from discrimination, intimidation, threats, and 
coercion  for the purpose of interfering with  the performance of their job responsibilities .  A 
recipient, therefore, must not interfere with the Title IX coordinator’s participat ion in complaint 
investigations  and monitoring of the recipient’s efforts to comply with and carry out its 
responsibilities under Title IX.  Rather, a recipient should encourage its Title IX coordinator to help 
it comply with Title IX and promote  gender eq uity in education.  
Support for Title IX Coordinators  
Title IX coordinators must have the full support of their institutions to be able to effectively 
coordinate the recipient’s compliance with Title IX.  Such support include s making the role of the 
Title I X coordinator visible in the school community  and ensuring that the Title IX coordinator is 
sufficiently knowledgeable about  Title IX and the recipient’s policies and procedures .  Because 
educational institutions vary in size and educational level, there are a variety of ways in which 
recipients can ensure that their Title IX coordinators have community -wide visibility  and 
comprehensive  knowledge and training.

Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.
A. V
isibility of Title IX Coordinators  
Under the Department’s Title IX regulations , a recipient has specific obligations to make the role of 
its Title IX coordinator visible to the school community.  A recipient must post a notice of 
nondiscrimination stating that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex  and that questions 
regarding Title IX may be referred to the recipient’s Title IX coordinator or to OCR.  The notice must 
be included in any bulletins, announcements, publications, catalogs, application forms, or 
recruitment materials distributed to the school community, including all applicants for ad mission 
and employment, students and parents or guardians of elementary and secondary school students, 
employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or 
professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the 
recipient .7   
In addition, the recipient must always notify students and employees  of the name, office address, 
telephone number, and email address of the Title IX coordinator , including in its notice of 
nondiscrimination .8  Because it may be unduly burdensome for a recipient to republish printed 
materials that include the Title IX coordinator’s name and individual  information each time  a 
person leaves the Title  IX coordinator position,  a recipient may identify its coordinator only through 
a position title in printed materials and may provide an  email address established for the position 
of the  Title IX coordinator, such as TitleIXCoordinator@school.edu , so long as the email is 
immediately redirected to the employee  serving as the Title IX coordinator .  However, the 
recipient’s website must reflect complete and current information  about the Title IX coordinator . 
Recipients with more than one Title IX coordinator must notify  students and employees of the lead 
Title IX coordinator’s contact information in its notice of nondiscrimination, and should make available the contact information for its other Title IX coordinators as well .  In doing so, recipients 
should include  any ad ditional information that would help students and employees identify which 
Title IX coordinator to contact, such as each Title IX coordinator’s specific geographic region ( e.g., a 
particular elementary school or part of a college campus) or Title IX area o f specialization (e.g., 
gender equity in academic programs  or athletics , harassment , or complaints from employees ). 
The Title IX coordinator’s  contact information must be widely distributed  and should be easily 
found on the recipient’s website and in various publications.
9  By publicizing the functions and 
responsibilities of the Title IX coordinator, the recipient demonstrates to the school community its 
commitment to complying with Title IX and its support of the Title IX coordinator’s efforts.

S
upporting the Title IX coordinator in the establishment and maintenance of a strong and visible 
role in the community  helps to ensure that members of the school community know and trust that 
they can reach out to the Title IX coordinator for assistance.  OCR encou rages  recipients to create a 
page on the recipient’s website that includes the name and contact information of its  Title IX 
coordinator(s), relevant Title IX policies and grievance procedures , and other resources related to 
Title IX compliance and  gender e quity .  A link to this page should be prominently displayed on the 
recipient’s homepage.  
To supplement the recipient’s  notification obligations, the Department collects and publishes 
information from educational institutions about the employees they design ate as Title IX 
coordinators.   OCR’s Civil Rights Data Collection  (CRDC) collects information from the nation's 
public school districts and elementary and secondary schools , including whether they have civil 
rights coordinators for discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and disability, and the coordinators’ 
contact information.10  The Department’s Office of Postsecondary Education collects information 
about Title IX coordinators from postsecondary institutions in reports required under the Jeanne 
Clery Di sclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act and the Higher 
Education Opportunity Act.11 
B. Training of Title IX Coordinators  
Recipient s must ensure that their Title IX coordinators are appropriately trained and possess 
comprehensive knowledge  in all areas over which they have responsibility in order to  effectively 
carry out those responsibilities, including the recipients ’ policies and procedures on sex 
discrimination and all complaints raising Title IX issues throughout the institution.  The resource 
guide accompanying this letter outlines some of the key issues covered by Title IX and provides 
references to Federal resources  related to those issues.  In addition, the coordinator s should be 
knowledgeable about other applicable F ederal and State laws, regulations , and policies that 
overlap with Title IX.12  In most cases, the recipient will need to provide an employee with training 
to act as its  Title IX coordinator.  The training should explain the different facets of Title IX, 
including re gulatory provisions , applicable OCR guidance , and the recipient’s Title IX policies  and 
grievance procedures .  Because  these  laws , regulations, and OCR guidance may be updated, and 
10 OCR began collecting this information through the CRDC for the 2013- 2014 school year.   More information about the 
CRDC is available at http://www.ed.gov/ocr/data. html . 
11 The Department will begin collecting this information in 2015.  More information about the Clery Act data collection 
is available at http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/campus.html . 
12 See, e.g., the Family Education al Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. §1232g, and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. 
Part 99; and the Clery Act, 20 U.S.C. §  1092(f), and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 668.   These documents 
only address an  institution’s compliance with Title IX and do not address its obligations under other F ederal laws, such 
as the Clery Act .                                                         Page 7—Dear Colleague L etter: Title IX Coordinators

re
cipient policies and procedures may be revised , the best way to ensure Ti tle IX coordinators have 
the most current knowledge of Federal and State laws, regulations, and policies relating to Title IX 
and gender equity is for a recipient to provide regular training to the Title IX coordinator, as well as 
to all employees whose responsibilities may relate to the recipient’s obligations under Title IX.  
OCR’s regional offices  can provide technical assistance , and opportunities for training may be 
available through Equity Assistance Centers, State educational agencies, private organi zations, 
advocacy groups, and community colleges .  A Title IX coordinator may also find it helpful to seek 
mentorship from a more experienced Title IX coordinator and to collaborate  with other Title IX 
coordinators in the region (or who serve similar institutions) to share information, knowledge, and expertise.  
In rare circumstances, an employee’s prior training and experience may sufficiently prepare that 
employee to act as the recipient’s Title IX coordinator.  For example, the combination of effective 
prior training and experience investigating complaints of sex discrimination, together with training 
on current Title IX regulations, OCR guidance, and the recipient institution’s policies and grievance 
procedures may be sufficient preparation for that emplo yee to effectively carry out the 
responsibilities of the Title IX coordinator.  
Conclusion  
Title IX coordinators are  invaluable resources to recipients  and students  at all educational levels.  
OCR is committed to helping recipients and Title IX coordinators  understand and comply with their 
legal obligations under Title IX.  If you need technical assistance, please contact the OCR regional 
office serving your S tate or territory by visiting

1-800-421-3481; TDD 1 -800- 877-8339.  
Thank you for supporting your Title IX coordinators to help ensure  that all students have equal 
access to educational opportunities , regardless of sex.  I look forward to continuing to work with 
recipients nationwide to help ensure that each and every recipient has at least one knowledgeable 
Title IX coordinator with the authority  and support needed to prevent and address sex 
discrimination in our nation’s schools.  
Sincerely,

A. Scope of Title IX  
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits  discrimination based on sex in 
education programs  and activities  in federally  funded  schools at all levels .1  If any part of a school 
district or college receives any Federal funds for any purpose, all of the operations of the district or 
college are covered by Title IX.2 
Title IX protects students, employees, applicants for admission and employment , and other persons 
from all forms of sex discrimination, including discrimination based on gender identity  or failure to 
conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity.  All students (as well as other 
persons) at recipient institutions are protected by Title IX —regardless of their sex, sexual 
orientation, gender identity,  part- or full- time status, disability, race, or national origin —in all 
aspects of a recipient’s educational  programs and activities . 
As part of their obligations under Title IX, a ll recipients of F ederal financial assistance must 
designate at least one em ployee to coordinate their efforts to compl y with and carry out their 
responsibilities under Title IX and must notify all students and employees of that employee’s  
contact information.3  This employee is generally referred to as the Title IX coordinator.   
The essence of Title IX is that an institution may not exclude, separate, deny benefits to, or 
otherwise treat differently any person on the basis of sex unless expressly authorized to do so 
under Title IX or the Department’s implementing regulations .4  When a recipient is considering 
relying on one of the  exception s to this general rule (several of which are discussed below), Title IX 
coordinators should be involved at every stage and work with school officials and legal counsel to 
help determine whether the exception is applicable and, if so, properly executed.  
1 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 –1688.  The Department of Justice shares enforcement authority over Title IX with OCR.   The 
Department  of Education ’s Title IX regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 106,  are available at 
http://www.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite -34cfr106.html .  Although Title IX and the Department’s implementing 
regulations apply  to any recipient institution that off ers education programs or activities, this resource guide  focuses 
on Title IX coordinators designated by local educational agencies, schools, colleges, and universities.  
2 An educational institution that is controlled by a religious organization is exempt from Title  IX to the extent that 
compliance would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.  20 U.S.C. §  1681(a)(3); 34 C.F.R. 
§ 106.12(a).  For application of this provision to a specific institution, please contact the appropriate  OCR regional 
office.

B. Responsibilities and Authority of a Title IX Coordinator  
Although the recipient is ultimately responsible for ensuring that it complies with Title IX and other 
laws, the Title IX coordinator is  an integral part of a recipient ’s system atic approach to ensur ing 
nondiscrimination, including a nondiscriminatory environment.  Title IX coordinators can be 
effective agents for ensuring gender equity within their institutions only when they are provided 
with the appropriate authority and support necessary to coordinate the ir institution’s  Title IX 
compliance , including access to all of the ir institution ’s relevant information and resources.  
One of the most important facets of the Title IX coordinator’s re sponsibility is helping to ensure the 
recipient’s compliance with Title IX ’s administrative requirements .  The Title IX coordinator must 
have knowledge of the recipient’s policies and procedures on sex discrimination and should be 
involved in the drafting and revision of such policies and procedures to help to ensure that they 
comply with the requirements of Title IX.  
The coordinator may help the recipient by coordinat ing the implementation and administration of 
the recipient’s  procedures for resolving Titl e IX complaints , including educating the school 
community on how to file a complaint alleging a violation  of Title IX, investigating complaints, 
working with law enforcement when necessary, and ensuring that complaints are resolved promptly and appropriate ly.  The coordinator should also coordinate the recipient’s response to all 
complaints involving possible sex discrimination to monitor outcomes, identify patterns, and assess 
effects on the campus climate.  Such coordination can help an institution avoid Title IX violations, 
particularly violations involving sexual harassment  and violence , by preventing incidents from 
recurring or becoming systemic problems.   Title IX does not specify who should determine the 
outcome of Title IX complaints or the actions the school will take in response to such complaints.  
The Title IX coordinator could play this role, provided there are no conflicts of interest, but does 
not have to.    
The Title IX coordinator should also assist the institution in developing a method to survey the 
school climate and coordinate the collection and analysis of information from that survey.  Further, 
the coordinator should monitor students’ participation in athletics and across academic fields to 
identify programs with disproportionate enrollment based on sex and  ensure that sex 
discrimination is not causing any disproportionality  or otherwise negatively affecting a student’s 
access to equal educational opportunities.  
The Title IX coordinator should provide  training and technical assistance on school policies related 
to sex discrimination  and develop programs , such as assemblies  or college trainings , on issues 
related to Title IX to assist the recipient in making sure that all members  of the school community , 
including students and staff, are aware of their rights and obligations under Title IX.  To perform 
 Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 3—Title IX Resource Guide  
this responsibility effectively, the coordinator should regularly assess the adequacy of current 
training opportunities and programs and propose improvements as appropriate.    
A recipient can designate more than one Title IX coordinator, which may be particularly helpful in 
larger school districts , colleges , and universities.  It may also be helpful to designate specific 
employees to coordinate certain Title IX compliance issues ( e.g., gender  equity in academic 
programs  or athletics , harassment, or complaints from employees ).  If a recipient has multiple Title 
IX coordinators, then it should designate one  lead Title IX coordinator who has ultimate oversight 
responsibility . 
Because Title IX prohibits discrimination in all aspects of a recipient’s education programs and 
activities, the Title IX coordinator should work closely with many different members of the school 
community, such as administrators, counselors, athletic directors, non -professio nal counselors or 
advocates , and legal  counsel.   Although these employees may not be formally designated as Title IX 
coordinators, the Title IX coordinator may need to work with them because their job 
responsibilities relate to the recipient’s obligations under Title IX.  The recipient should ensure that 
all employees whose work relates to Title IX communicate with one another and that these 
employees  have the support they need to ensure consistent practices and enforcement of the 
recipient’s policies and compliance with Title IX.   The coordinator should also be available to meet 
with the school community, including other employees , students , and parents or guardians, as 
needed  to discuss any issues related to Title IX .

C. Title IX’s Administrative Requirements  
The administrative requirements in the Department’s Title IX regulations are the underpinning of 
both the Title IX coordinator’s job and a recipient’s compliance with Title IX; their purpose is to  
ensure that a recipient maintains an environment for students and employees that is free from 
unlawful sex discrimination in all aspects of the educational experience, including academics, 
extracurricular activities, and athletics.  These requirements provide that a recipient must  establish 
a system for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints .  This allows an institution to 
resolve complaints of discrimination  without the need for involvement by outside entities, such as 
the Federal government.  They also provide that a recipient must ensure that members of the 
school community are aware of their rights under Title IX, have  the contact information for the Title 
IX coordinator, and know how to file a complaint alleging a violation  of Title IX . 
1. Grie vance Procedures  
The Department’s Title IX regulations require a recipient to adopt and publish grievance procedures 
providing for the prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints under Title IX.  These procedures provide an instituti on with a mechanism for discovering incidents of 
discrimination or harassment as early as possible and for effectively correcting individual and 
systemic problems.   The procedures that each school uses to resolve Title IX complaints may vary  
depending on the nature of the allegation, the age of the student or students involved, the size and administrative structure of the school, state or local legal requirements, and what it ha s learned 
from past experiences .    
There are several ways in which a Title IX c oordinator can coordinate the recipient’s compliance 
with the Title IX regulatory requirement  regarding grievance procedures.  
• First, the Title IX coordinator should work with the recipient to help make sure that the 
grievance procedures are written in lang uage appropriate for the age of the audience (such 
as elementary, middle school, high school, or postsecondary students), and that they are 
easily underst ood and widely disseminated.  
• Second, the Title IX coordinator should review  the grievance procedures to help determine 
whether they incorporate all of the elements required for the prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints under Title IX, consistent with the Title IX 
regulatory requirement and OCR guidance.  
• Third, the Title IX coordinator should communicate with  students, parents or guardians, and 
school employees to help them understand the recipient’s grievance procedures; train 
employees and students about how Title IX protects against sex discrimination; and provide 
consultation and information regarding Title IX requirements to potential complainants.  
 Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 5—Title IX Resource Guide  
• Fourth, the Title IX coordinator is responsible for coordinating the grievance process  and 
making certain that individual complaints are handled properly .  This coordination 
respon sibility may  include  informing all parties regarding the process, notifying all parties 
regarding grievance decisions and of the right to and procedures for appeal, if any; 
monitoring compliance with all of the requirements and timelines specified in the g rievance 
procedures ; and maintaining grievance and compliance records and files . 
• Finally, the Title IX coordinator should work with the recipient to help ensure that its 
grievance procedures are accessible to English language learners5 and students with 
disabilities.6

2. Notice of Nondiscrimination  and Contact Information for the Title IX Coordinator  
The Department’s Title IX regulations require a  recipient to publish a statem ent that it does not 
discriminate on the basis of sex in the education programs or activities it operates  and that it is 
required by T itle IX not to discriminate in such a manner.  The notice must also state that questions 
regarding Title IX may be referred to the recipient’s Title IX coordinator or to OCR.   
The notice must be widely distributed to all applicants for admission and employment, students 
and parents or guardians of elementary and secondary school students, employees, sources of 
referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient.  The notice should be 
prominently posted on the recipient’s website, at various locations on campus, and in electronic 
and printed publications for general distribution.  In addition, the notice must be included in any 
bulletins, announcements, publications, catalogs, application forms, or recruitment materials.   
A recipient must notify all student s and employees  of the name  or title , office address, telephone 
number, and email address of the Title IX coordinator, including in its notice of nondiscrimination.  The notice should also state any other job title that the Title IX coordinator might have.   Recipients 
must notify students and employees of the Title IX coordinator’s contact information in its notice of 
nondiscrimination .  Recipients with more than one Title IX coordinator must notify the s chool 
community  of the lead Title IX coordinator’s contact information in its notice of nondiscrimination, 
and should also make available the contact information for its other Title IX coordinators as well t o 
ensure consistent practices and standards in handling complaints .  In doing so, recipients should 
include any additional information that would help students and employees identify which Title IX 
coordinator to contact, such as each Title IX coordinator’s specific geographic region ( e.g., a 
particular elementary school or part of a college campus) or are a of specialization within Title IX 
(e.g., gender equity in academic programs  or athletics , harassment, or complaints from 
employees ).  Because social media are now widespread means for students and other members of 
the school community to communicate, a r ecipient should also make the Title IX coordinator’s 
contact information available on social media to the extent that they are supported or used by the 
recipient . 
The content of the notice must be complete and include current information .  The Title IX 
coordinator should work with the recipient to make sure the text of the notice complies with all 
applicable requirements , that the notice is published and properly displayed, and the content  of 
the notice remains accurate .  One potentially low -cost way to hel p ensure that a recipient’s notice 
is properly disseminated and current on the recipient’s website is to create a page on the website 
that includes the name and contact information of the recipient’s Title IX coordinator(s), relevant 
Title IX policies and grievance procedures, and other resources related to Title IX compliance and  
gender equity.   A link to this page should be prominently displayed on the recipient’s homepage.

D. Application of Title IX to Various Issues  
Below is a summary of some of the key issues covered by Title IX, as well as some general  
information on the legal requirements applicable to each issue area, including citations to the 
relevant Departmental regulatory provisions and references to OCR’s guidance  that address the 
issue .  The discussion of each Title IX issue incl udes recommende d best practices  to help a recipient 
meet its obligations under Title IX.  
1. Recruitment, Admissions, and Counseling  
Title IX prohibits  recipient institutions of vocational education, professional education, graduate 
higher education, and public colleges and universities from discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or admission of students.
7  The Title IX coordinator at these recipient institutions 
should help the recipient to ensure that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in recruitmen t 
and admissions by reviewing the recipient’s recruitment materials, admission forms, and policies 
and practices in these areas . 
The Department’s Title IX regulations also prohibit all recipients from discriminating on the basis of 
sex in counseling or guiding students or applicants for admission.  The Title IX coordinator should 
review any materials used for counseling students in terms of class or career selection, or for 
counseling applicants for admission, to ensure that the recipient does not use diffe rent materials 
for students based on sex or use materials that permit or require different treatment of students 
based on sex.  
At all types of recipient institutions covered by Title IX, the Title IX coordinator should also work 
with school officials  to help remind the school community that all students must have equal access 
to all programs.  Many fields of study continue to be affected by sex-based disparities in 
enrollment ; these are typically called nontraditional fields.  For example, some fields of st udy in 
science, technology, engineering , and mathematics or career and technical education are often 
affected by  disproportionate enrollment of students based on sex , which triggers a duty of inquiry 
on the part of the recipient.  Title IX coordinators can  help ensure that such disparities are not the 
result of discrimination on the basis of sex by reviewing enrollment data and working  with other 
employees of the recipient to review counseling practices and counseling or appraisal materials .  
Under certain circumstances, recipients might encourage students to explore nontraditional fields  
to address underrepresentation of students of that sex  in those fields . 
7 20 U.S.C. §1681(a)(1).  The Department’s Title IX regulations regarding admissions do not apply to private institutions 
of undergraduate higher education or to any public institution of undergraduate higher education which traditionally 
and continually from its establishment has had a policy of admitting only students of one sex.  34 C.F.R. § 106.15.

2. Financial Assistance   
Generally, a recipient may not: (a) provide different amounts or types of financial assistance, limit 
eligibility  for such assistance , apply different criteria or otherwise discriminate  on the basis of sex  in 
administering such assistance ; or (b) assist any agency, organization , or person which offers sex -
restricted student aid. 
The Department’s Title IX regulations provide three exceptions to these general prohibitions.  
Recipients are permitted to administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, 
or other awards that are restricted to members of one sex if the award is: (a) created by certain 
legal instruments, including wills or tr usts, or by acts of a foreign government, provided the overall 
effect is nondiscriminatory ; (b) for study at foreign institutions if  the recipient provides, or 
otherwise makes available reasonable opportunities for similar studies for members of the other 
sex; or (c) athletic financial assistance.  The Department’s Title IX regulatory requirements 
regarding athletic financial assistance are discussed in the Athletics section, below.  
To help the recipient ensure its compliance with these requirements, the Ti tle IX coordinator 
should help the recipient develop, and subsequently monitor, the procedures and practices for 
awarding financial assistance and for administering or aiding any foundation, trust, agency, organization, person, or foreign government in awarding financial assistance to its students.

 Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and

3. Athletics  
The Department’s Title IX regulations prohibit sex discrimination in interscholastic, intercollegiate, 
club, or intramural athletic s offered by a  recipient institution, including with respect to (a) student 
interests and abilities ; (b) athletic benefits and opportunities ; and (c) athletic financial assistance . 
(a) Student Interests and A bilities  
Under the Department’s Title IX regulations, an institution must provide equal athletic 
opportunities for members of both sexes and effectively accommodate students’ athletic interests 
and abilities .  OCR uses a three -part test to determine whether an institution is providing 
nondiscriminatory athletic participation opportunities in compliance with the Title IX regulation. 
The test provides the following three compliance options:  
1. Whether participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments; or  
2. Where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among athletes, 
whether the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the members 
of that sex; or  
3. Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among athletes, and the institution 
cannot show a history and continuing practice of program expansion, as described above, 
whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex 
have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.  
The three -part test is intended to allow institutions to maintain flexibil ity and control over their 
athletic programs consistent with Title IX’s nondiscrimination requirements.  The three -part test 
furnishes an institution with three individual avenues to choose from when determining how it will 
provide individuals of each sex with nondiscriminatory opportunities to participate in athletics.  If 
an institution has met any part of the three -part test, OCR will determine that the institution is 
meeting this requirement.  
To coordinate the institution’s compliance with this require ment, the Title IX coordinator should 
compare its enrollment data to the number of athletic participation opportunities it offers ; review 
the institution’s history of expanding participation opportunities for students of the underrepresented sex ; and evalu ate whether there is unmet interest in a particular sport, whether 
there is sufficient ability to sustain a team in the sport, and whether there is a reasonable 
expectation of competition for the team .

(b) Athletic Benefits and Opportunities  
The Department’s Title IX regulations and OCR guidance  require  that recipients that operate or 
sponsor interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics provide equal athletic 
opportuni ties for members of both sexes.   In determining whether an institution is providing equal 
opportunity in athletics , the regulations require the Department to consider, among others, the 
following factors : (1) the provision of equipment and supplies; (2) scheduling of games and practice 
time; (3) travel and per diem allowances; (4) opportunity for coaching and academic tutoring; (5) 
assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors; (6) provision of locker rooms, and practice 
and competitive facilities; (7) provision of medical and training facilities and services; (8) housing and dining services; (9) publicity; (10) recruitment; and (11) support services .  These factors are 
sometimes referred to as the laundry list . 
As part of the recipient ’s obligation to provide equal athletic opportunity to its students, OCR 
encourages Title IX coordinators to w ork with the recipient to periodically review and compare the 
distribution of athletic benefits and opportunities by sex in each of these areas, including financial 
expenditures on male and female athletic teams.  
For more information about each of these areas, please review :

 Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 14—Title IX Resource Guide  
(c) Athletic Financial Assistance  
The Department’s Title IX regulations specif y that if a  recipient awards athletic financial assistance, 
including athletic scholarships  or grants -in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such 
awards for members of each sex in substantial proportion to the number of students of each sex 
participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.  Separate athletic financial assistance for 
members of each sex may be provided as part of separate athletic teams for members of  each sex.  
The Title IX coordinator should help coordinate the recipient ’s efforts to ensure  that the athletic 
financial assistance awarded by the recipient complies  with these provisions  by working with the 
institution and its athletics department.

assistance , please review :

4. Sex-Based Harassment  
In order to best perform academically and  to have equal access to all aspects of a recipient’s 
educational programs and activities, students must not be subjected to unlawful harassment, 
either in the classroom or while participatin g in other education programs or activities.8 
Title IX prohibits sex -based  harassment by peers, employees, or third parties that is sufficiently 
serious to deny  or limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education 
programs and activities  (i.e., creates a hostile environment ).  When a recipient  knows or reasonably 
should know of possible sex-based harassment, it must take immediate and appropriate steps to 
investigate or otherwise determine what occurred.  If an investigation reveals that the harassment 
created a hostile environment, the recipient must take prompt and effective steps reasonably 
calculated to end the harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent the harassment from 
recurring, and, as appropriate, remedy  its effects.  
Title IX  prohibits several types of sex-based harassment.  Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct 
of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other 
verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sex ual nature.  Sexual violence is a form of sexual 
harassment and refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person’s will or where a person 
is incapable of giving consent ( e.g., due to the student’s age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because 
an in tellectual or other disability prevents the student from having the capacity to give consent).  A 
number of different acts fall into the category of sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, 
sexual battery, sexual abuse, and sexual coercion.   Gender -based harassment is another  form of 
sex-based harassment and refers to unwelcome  conduct based on an individual’s actual or 
perceived sex, including harassment based on gender identity  or nonconformity with  sex 
stereotypes , and not necessarily involving c onduct of a sexual nature .  All of these types of sex -
based harassment  are forms  of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX.  
Harassing conduct may take many forms, including verbal acts and name -calling, as well as non -
verbal behavior, such as graphic an d written statements, or conduct that is physically threatening, 
harmful, or humiliating.  The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a repetitive 
series of incidents to prove a hostile environment, particularly if the conduct is physical.   Indeed, a 
single or isolated incident of sexual violence may create a hostile environment.  
Title IX protects all students from sex -based harassment, regardless of the sex of the alleged 
perpetrator or complainant, including when they are members of the s ame sex.  Title IX ’s sex 
discrimination  prohibition extends to claims  of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to 
8 A Title IX coordinator may receive reports of sex -based harassment of any member of the school community.  It is the 
Title IX coordinator’s responsibility to help make su re that such compla ints are processed appropriately.  
                                                       Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 16—Title IX Resource Guide  
conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity , and a recipient must accept and 
appropriately respond to all complaints of sex discrimination.  Similarly, the actual or perceived 
sexual orientation or gender identity of the parties does not change a recipient ’s obligations.  A 
recipient should investigate and resolve allegations of sexual or gender -based harassment of  
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students using the same procedures and standards that it 
uses in all complaints involving sex -based harassment .  The fact that an incident of sex-based 
harassment  may be accompanied by anti- gay comments or be partly  based on a student’s actual or 
perceived sexual orientation does not relieve a recipient of its obligation under Title IX to 
investigate and remedy such an incident. 
The Title IX coordinator must coordinate the recipient’s efforts to accept and appropriat ely 
respond to all complaints of sex discrimination  and should work with the recipient to prevent 
sexual and gender- based harassment.      
• First, the Title IX coordinator should assist in any training the recipient provides t o the 
school community, including all employees, as to what conduct constitutes sexual and 
gender -based harassment  and how to respond appropriately  when  it occurs . 
• Second, the Title IX coordinator should help the recipient develop a method  appropriate to 
their institution to survey the c ampus climate , evaluate whether any discriminatory 
attitudes pervade the school culture, and determine whether any harassment or other 
problematic behaviors are occurring, where they happen, which students are responsible, 
which students are targeted, and how those conditions may be best remedied.  
• Third, because the Title IX coordinator must have knowledge of all Title IX reports and 
complaints at the recipient institution, the Title IX coordinator is generally in the best 
position to  evaluate confidentiality requests from complainants in the context of providing  
a safe , nondiscriminatory environment for all students.  
• Fourth, the Title IX coordinator should coordinate  recordkeeping (for instance, in a 
confidential log maintained by the Title IX coordinator),  monitor incidents to help identify 
students or employees who have multiple complaints filed against them  or who have been 
repeated targets , and address any patterns or systemic problems that arise, including 
making school officials aware of these patterns  or systemic problems as appropriate . 
• Fifth , the Title IX coordinator should  recommend, as necessary, that the recipient increase  
safety measures, such as monitoring , supervision, or security at locations or activities where 
harassment has occurred.

remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 17—Title IX Resource Guide  
• Finally, the Title IX coordinator should regularly review the effectiveness of the recipient’s 
efforts to ensure that the recipient institution is free from sexual and gender- based 
harassment, and use that information to recommend future proactive steps that the  
recipient can take  to comply with Title IX and protect the school community .

5. Pregnant and Parenting Students  
Under the Department’s Title IX  regulations , recipient s are prohibited from: (a) applying any rule 
concerning parental, family, or marital status that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;  or 
(b) discriminating against or excluding any student from its education program or activity, including 
any class or extracurricular activity  on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, 
termination of pregnancy , or recovery therefrom .  Institutions of vocational education, professional 
education, graduate higher education , and public colleges and universities are prohibited from  
making pre -admission inquiries as to the marital status of an applicant for admissio n. 
The Title IX coordinator should work with the recipient on its obligation not to  discriminat e against 
students based on their parental, family, or marital status, or  exclud e pregnant or parenting 
students from participating in any educational program, including extracurricular activities.   The 
Title IX coordinator is responsible for coordinating the recipient’s response to  complaints of 
discrimination against pregnant and parenting students .  In addition, the Title IX coordinator should 
provide training to students so they know that Title IX prohibits discrimination against pregnant and parenting students, provide workshops to administrators, teachers, and other staff on the  
Department’s  Title IX regulations and OCR guidance related to pregnant and parenting students, 
and assist  the recipient in helping to meet the unique educational, child care, and health care 
needs of pregnant and parenting students.

6. Discipline  
The Department’s Title IX regulations prohibit a recip ient from subjecting any person to separate or 
different rules  of behavior , sanctions, or other treatment, such as discriminatory discipline , based 
on sex.  
The Title IX coordinator should review the recipient’s discipline policies to help make sure they ar e 
not discriminatory.   In addition, the Title IX coordinator should work with other coordinators or 
school employees to help the recipient keep and maintain accurate and complete records 
regarding its disciplinary incidents and monitor the recipient’s administration of its discipline policies to ensure that they are not administered in a discriminatory manner.  For example, the 
Title IX coordinator should review the recipient’s disciplinary records and data to ensure that 
similarly situated students are not  being disciplined differently based on sex for the same offense 
and that the recipient’s discipline policies do not have a n unlawful  disparate impact on students  
based on sex .  The Title IX coordinator should also help the recipient to ensure that students are 
not disciplined based on their gender identity or for failing to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity in their behavior or appearance.

discipline, please review :

7. Single -Sex Education  
A recipient is generally prohibited from providing any of its education programs or activities 
separately on the basis of sex, or requiring or refusing participation by students on the  basis of sex  
unless expressly authorized to do so under Title IX or the Department’s implementing regulations .  
There are some limited exceptions , the most significant of which are outlined  below . 
(a) Schools  
A recipient generally may offer a single -sex nonvo cational elementary or secondary school under 
Title IX only if it offers a substantially equal school to students of the other sex.9  The substantially 
equal  school may be either single -sex or coeducational.   The Department’s Title IX regulations 
include a  non-exhaustive list of factors that are relevant to determining whether a school is 
substantially equal to a single -sex school.  The factors include the admission  criteria and policies ; 
the educational benefits provided, including the quality, range, and content of curriculum and 
other services , and the quality and availability of books, instructional materials, and technology; 
the qualifications of faculty and staff; geographic accessibility; the quality and rang e of 
extracurricular offerings; the quality , accessibility, and availability of facilities and resources 
provided; and intangible features, such as reputation of faculty.  Although the schools do not need 
to be identical with respect to each factor, they need to be substantially equal.  This means that if 
one school is significantly superior with respect to one factor, or slightly superior with respect to 
many  factors, the schools are likely not substantially equal.  
If the recipient offers a single -sex school, then the district’s Title IX coordinato r should be involved 
in assessing the recipient’s compliance with Title IX by helping to ensure that the recipient offers a 
substantially equal single -sex school  or coeducational school . 
9 Title IX does not prohibit the operation of a single -sex nonvocational private elementary or secondary school or a 
single -sex nonvocational private institution of undergraduate higher education.   20 U. S.C. § 1681(a)(1); 34 C.F.R. 
§ 106.15(d).   Title IX permits the operation of a nonvocational public charter school that is a single -school local 
educational agency under State law without requiring the operation of a substantially equal school for the excl uded 
sex. 
                                                       Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and 
remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 21—Title IX Resource Guide  
(b) Classes and Extracurricular Activities  
The Department’s Title IX reg ulations do not prohibit recipients from grouping students in physical 
education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual 
performance developed and applied without regard to sex  or using  requirements based on vocal  
range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.  
The Department’s Title IX regulations identify the following categories for which a recipient may 
intentionall y separate students by sex: (a) contact sports in physi cal education classes; (b) classes 
or portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools that deal primarily with human 
sexuality; and (c) n onvocational classes and extracurricular activities within a coeducational, 
nonvocational elementary or secondary scho ol if certain criteria are met.  
With respect to the third category , a recipient may offer a single -sex nonvocational class or 
extracurricular activity  in a coeducational , nonvocational  elementary or secondary school if the 
class is based on one of t wo important objectives: to improve its students’ educational 
achievement through its overall established policy to provide diverse educational opportunities or to meet the particular, identified educational needs of its students.  The single -sex nature of  each 
class must be substantially related to achievement of the important objective  and the recipient 
must implement its important objective in an evenhanded manner .  In addition, enrollment in  a 
single -sex class must be completely voluntary and the recipient must provide a substantially equal 
coeducational class in the same subject to all students, and may be required to provide a substantially equal single -sex class for students of the excluded sex.  The factors that are relevant 
to determining whether a single -sex class and a coeducational class are substantially equal are 
similar to those used to determine whether schools are substantially equal.  If a recipient provides  
a single -sex class under this regulatory exception, it is also required to conduct a periodic 
evaluation of the class and the original justification behind the class at least every two years.   The 
periodic evaluation must ensure that each single -sex class is based upon a genuine justification and 
does not rely on overly broad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences 
of either sex, and that each single -sex class or extracurricular activity is  substantially related to the 
achievement of the imp ortant objective for the class .  
If the recipient offers a single -sex class, then the Title IX coordinator should be involved in assessing 
the recipient’s compliance with Title IX, both when determining whether and how single -sex classes 
can be offered and during the recipient’s periodic review of single -sex offerings.  The Title IX 
coordinator’s role may include assisting with the preparation and review of the required periodic 
evaluations, tracking  and review ing complaints involving single -sex classes , confirming  that student 
enrollment  in any single -sex class is completely voluntary , and helping to ensure that the recipient 
offers a substantially equal coeducational class and, as appropriate, substantially equal single -sex 
class , for each single -sex class offered .  The Title IX coordinator should also help ensure that

transgender students are treated consistent with their gender identity in the context of single -sex 
classes.

8. Employment  
Under the Department’s Title IX  regulations , a recipient is generally prohibited from discriminating 
on the basis of sex in any employment  or recruitment, consideration or selection for employment , 
whether full -time or part -time .10  This includes employment actions such as  recruitment, hiring, 
promotion, compensation, grants of leave, and benefits.  A recipient must make employment 
decisions in a nondiscriminatory manner, and may not enter into contracts, includin g those with 
employment agencies or unions, that have the direct or indirect effect of subjecting employees or 
students to discrimination based on sex.  Additionally, Title IX’s employment provisions protect against discrimination based on an applicant’s o r employee’s pregnan cy or  marital or parent al 
status.  Finally, a recipient may not  employ students in a way that discriminates against one sex, or 
provide services to any other organization that does so.  
The Title IX coordinator should help the recipient in making  sure school employees are aware  that 
the Title IX coordinator is available to help employees as well as students.  The Title IX coordinator should be familiar with the recipient’s employment policies and procedures, and train the 
appropriate huma n resource employees regarding the recipient’s obligations under Title IX.   
For more information about employment discrimination, please review : 
• 34 C.F.R. Part 106, Subpart E ; 34 C.F.R. § 106.38. 
10 Employees are also protected fr om discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment, by Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.  OCR does not enforce Title VII.  For information about Title VII, 
see the Equal Employment Opportunity Commiss ion's website at http://www.eeoc.gov .

remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 24—Title IX Resource Guide  
9. Retaliation  
A recipient cannot  retaliate against an individual , including a Title IX coordinator,  for the purpose of 
interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX.  Retaliation against an individual because 
the individual filed a complaint alleging a violation of Title IX; participated in a Title IX investigation, 
hearing, or proceeding ; or advocated for others’ Title IX rights  is also prohibited .  The recipient 
should ensure that individuals are not intimidated, threatened, coerced, or discriminated against for engaging in such activity .   
For more information about the prohibition against retaliation, please review : 
• 34 C.F.R. § 106.71 (incorporating by reference 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e)) ; and

E. Information Collection and Reporting  
The Department requires recipients to report information  about Title IX and other civil rights issues  
that may be useful to the work of Title IX c oordinators.  In addition, Title IX coordinators can play a 
helpful role in helping to ensure  that their institutions’ information  is accurate, comprehensive , and 
effectively used to cure civil rights violations or prevent them from occurring.  
OCR administ ers the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), which collects information on key 
education and civil rights issues from public local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools, including 
juvenile justice facilities, charter schools, alternative schools, and sch ools serving students with 
disabilities.  The information is  used by OCR in its enforcement efforts, by other Department offices 
and Federal agencies, and by the public, including policymakers and researchers.  
The CRDC collects information  on several key i ssue areas under Title IX that might help inform the 
Title IX coordinator’s work , including harassment or bullying ,11 discipline, and participation in 
various academic classes and programs, single -sex classes and activities, and interscholastic 
athletics.  In addition, the CRDC asks LEAs to report whether they have civil rights coordinators, including Title IX coordinators and to provide each coordinator’s contact information.   For Title IX 
coordinators at elementary and secondary schools, the CRDC  may be  a useful tool to monitor 
trends within their districts and schools to determine whether there are patterns or systemic problems under Title IX.  Additionally, the CRDC and other information  collections at the State and 
local levels can help  recipients and th eir Title IX coordinators identify patterns of disproportionality 
that may be rooted in sex discrimination.  For example, the CRDC’s information  about student 
enrollment in particular courses of study ( e.g., science, technology, engineering , and mathematic s 
courses) may help a Title IX coordinator determine whether a particular sex  is underrepresented  in 
such courses.  If so, the coordinator should investigate the possible causes of the disproportionality 
and then recommend measures for reaching greater pro portionality, as appropriate.  
11 The CRDC collects information  on allegations of harassment or bullying, students reported as harassed or bullied, and 
students disciplined for harassment or bullying, based on sex , race/color/national origin, and disability.  For allegations 
of harassment or bullying, data are also collected based on religion and sexual orientation.  As a best practice, OCR 
recommends that Title IX coordinators assist the recipient in training rele vant staff about how information on sex -
based harassment should be reported under the CRDC.  For example, relevant staff should be knowledgeable about the 
ways in which harassment based on sex and sexual orientation overlap, and informed that if an incident has multiple 
bases ( e.g., an incident in which a student was harassed both based on gender nonconformity (sex) and sexual 
orientation), the LEA should report all relevant bases under the CRDC.   In addition, the recipient should remind  staff 
who collect, maintain , and report information  to the Department of these requirements and of the district’s 
obligations, including keeping personally identifiable information private.

remains available on the web for historical purposes only.Page 26—Title IX Resource Guide  
The Department’s Office of Postsecondary Education also collects information  about Title IX 
coordinators from postsecondary institutions in reports required under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure 
of Campus Security Policy and Campu s Crime Statistics Act and the Higher Education Opportunity 
Act.12  Title IX coordinators in postsecondary settings should assist the institution’s officials in  
accurately report ing the required information.

Frequently Asked Questions About Sex Discrimination- Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits any educational institution  that receives federal financial assistance (such as grants or student loans)  from discriminating on the basis of sex. You can find the full text here.
Generally yes. All public school districts are covered by Title IX  because they receive some federal financial assistance and operate education  programs. All public colleges and universities and nearly all private colleges  and universities are covered because they receive assistance by participating  in federal student aid programs. There are some private schools that do not  receive any federal assistance, and Title IX does not apply to them.  Additionally, some schools are specifically exempt from certain parts of Title  IX. For example, Title IX includes an exemption for educational institutions  that are controlled by a religious organization but only to the extent that  Title IX’s application would not be consistent with the religious tenets of the  religious organization. Please see Exemptions from Title  IX for  more information.
Are all programs in a school, district, college, or university covered by Title IX if any part of the school receives federal financial assistance?
Yes. All programs are covered if the school district, college, or  university (“school”) receives federal financial assistance. Title IX covers  all the operations of a school that receives financial assistance including  academics, extracurricular activities, athletics, and other programs. Title IX  applies to all operations of a school, including those that take place in the  facilities of the school, on a school bus, or in a class or training program  sponsored by the school at another location. A school is also obligated to  respond to sexual harassment off campus when the school has substantial control  over both the person accused of engaging in harassment and the context in which  the harassment occurs. This includes sexual harassment that occurs in any  building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially  recognized by a postsecondary institution.
No. Title IX protects everyone who interacts  with a school from discrimination, including parents and guardians, students,  employees, and applicants.
OCR handles cases of sex discrimination  involving a range of issues, such as discriminatory discipline, harassment and  sexual violence, discrimination based on sexual orientation, discrimination based  on gender identity, and unequal access to educational resources (such as STEM  or career and technical education) or athletic opportunities.
Yes. All school districts, colleges, and  universities receiving federal financial assistance must designate at least one  employee to coordinate their efforts to comply with and carry out their  responsibilities under Title IX. This person is often referred to as a Title  IX coordinator.
Your school is required to publish your Title  IX coordinator’s contact information in its handbooks and catalogs for  students, employees, applicants, parents and guardians, and unions or  professional organizations. The Title IX coordinator’s contact information must  also be prominently posted on your school’s website. Title IX coordinators for  public school districts can also be found on OCR’s coordinators website  at http://www.ed.gov/civ-rts-coordinators. Title IX coordinators for colleges and  universities can also be found on the Office of Postsecondary Education's Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool.
How do I know whether an athletic program is providing an equal opportunity under Title IX?
If a school operates or sponsors an athletic  program, it must provide equal athletic opportunities for students. In  determining whether equal athletic opportunities are available, OCR considers  whether an institution is effectively accommodating the athletic interests and  abilities of students. OCR also considers whether a school is providing  equivalent benefits, opportunities, and treatment to its students, specifically  with respect to equipment and supplies; game and practice times; travel and per  diem allowances; coaching and academic tutoring; assignment and compensation of  coaches and tutors; locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities; medical  and training facilities and services; housing and dining facilities and  services; and publicity. The Title IX regulations specify that if a school  awards athletic financial assistance, it must provide reasonable opportunities  for awards for members of each sex in substantial proportion to the number of  students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate  athletics. For more detailed information, visit our Athletic Equity Resources page.
Sex-based harassment can take multiple forms.  Harassers can be students, school staff, or even someone visiting the school,  such as a student or employee from another school. Sexual harassment (including  sexual violence) is a form of sex-based harassment.
Sexual harassment refers to sex-based conduct  that satisfies one or more of the following: (1) quid pro quo harassment  by an employee of an educational institution—meaning that an employee offers  something to a student or other person in exchange for sexual conduct; (2)  unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would find to be so severe,  pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal  access to an education program or activity; or (3) sexual assault (as defined  in the Clery Act), dating violence, domestic  violence, or stalking (as defined in the Violence Against Women Act). Each of these categories of misconduct is a  serious violation that jeopardizes a victim’s equal access to education.
What are the responsibilities of school districts, colleges, and universities under Title IX to address sex-based harassment?
When a school has actual knowledge of sexual harassment in any of its programs or activities that take place in United States, it must respond promptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. A school is deliberately indifferent if its response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The Title IX Coordinator must promptly contact the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures, regardless of whether a formal complaint is filed, and to explain the process for filing a formal complaint.
In addition, if a formal complaint is filed, either by the complainant or the Title IX Coordinator, a school must:
For more information on the obligations, see  34 C.F.R. § 106.44(a) and the Questions and Answers resource and Appendix on the Title IX Regulations on Sexual Harassment.
How do educational institutions balance their Title IX obligations with individuals’ First Amendment rights?
OCR has consistently reaffirmed that the  Federal civil rights laws it enforces protect students from prohibited  discrimination, including unlawful harassment, and are not intended to restrict  expressive activities or speech protected under the U.S. Constitution’s First  Amendment.
Schools can protect students from verbal  harassment without running afoul of students’ and staff First Amendment rights.  For instance, in a situation where the First Amendment prohibits a public  university from restricting the rights of students to express persistent and  pervasive derogatory opinions about a particular sex, the university can  instead meet its obligation by, among other steps, communicating a rejection of  stereotypical, derogatory opinions and ensuring that competing views are heard.  Similarly, educational institutions can establish a campus culture that is  welcoming and respectful of the diversity of all students and institute campus  climate checks to assess the effectiveness of the school’s efforts to ensure  that it is free from harassment. Schools can also encourage students on all  sides of an issue to express disagreement over ideas or beliefs in a respectful  manner. Schools should be alert to take more targeted responsive action when  speech crosses over into direct threats or actionable speech or conduct. For  additional information on OCR’s policies and the First Amendment, click here.
OCR investigates and resolves allegations that  educational institutions that are recipients of federal funds have failed to  respond promptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent to sexual  harassment. Where OCR identifies concerns or violations, educational  institutions often resolve them with agreements requiring educational  institutions to adopt effective anti-harassment policies and procedures, train  staff and students, address the incidents in question, and take other steps to  restore a nondiscriminatory environment.
In addition to resolving investigations, OCR  takes steps to inform schools of their obligation to provide a  nondiscriminatory environment by issuing policy guidance.
Frequently Asked Questions About Sex Discrimination- Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
Yes. Title IX prohibits discrimination based  on sexual orientation and gender identity in education programs and activities  that receive federal financial assistance. This includes situations where  individuals are harassed; disciplined in a discriminatory manner; excluded  from, denied equal access to, or subjected to sex stereotyping in academic or  extracurricular opportunities and other education programs or activities;  denied the benefits of a school’s programs or activities; or otherwise treated  differently because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Rescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and remains available on the web for historical purposes only.
The Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education (Department),
issues a new document (revised guidance) that replaces the 1997 document entitled "Sexual
Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students,
or Third Parties", issued by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on March
13, 1997 (1997 guidance). We revised the guidance in limited respects in light
of subsequent Supreme Court cases relating to sexual harassment in schools.
The revised guidance reaffirms the compliance standards that OCR applies in
investigations and administrative enforcement of Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) regarding sexual harassment. The revised guidance
re-grounds these standards in the Title IX regulations, distinguishing them
from the standards applicable to private litigation for money damages and clarifying
their regulatory basis as distinct from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VII) agency law. In most other respects the revised guidance is
identical to the 1997 guidance. Thus, we intend the revised guidance to serve
the same purpose as the 1997 guidance. It continues to provide the principles
use to recognize and effectively respond to sexual harassment of students in
its program as a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance.
In March 1997, we published in the Federal Register "Sexual Harassment
Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third
Parties." 62 FR 12034. We issued the guidance pursuant to our authority
under Title IX, and our Title IX implementing regulations, to eliminate discrimination
based on sex in education programs and activities receiving Federal financial
assistance. It was grounded in longstanding legal authority establishing that
sexual harassment of students can be a form of sex discrimination covered by
Title IX. The guidance was the product of extensive consultation with interested
parties, including students, teachers, school administrators, and researchers.
Since the issuance of the 1997 guidance, the Supreme Court (Court) has issued
several important decisions in sexual harassment cases, including two decisions
specifically addressing sexual harassment of students under Title IX: Gebser
v. Lago Vista Independent School District ( Gebser ), 524 U.S. 274 (1998),
and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education ( Davis ), 526 U.S. 629 (1999).
The Court held in Gebser that a school can be liable for monetary damages if
a teacher sexually harasses a student, an official who has authority to address
the harassment has actual knowledge of the harassment, and that official is
deliberately indifferent in responding to the harassment. In Davis , the Court
announced that a school also may be liable for monetary damages if one student
sexually harasses another student in the schools program and the conditions
The Court was explicit in Gebser and Davis that the liability standards established
in those cases are limited to private actions for monetary damages. See, e.g.,
Gebser , 524 U.S. 283, and Davis , 526 U.S. at 639. The Court acknowledged,
by contrast, the power of Federal agencies, such as the Department, to "promulgate
and enforce requirements that effectuate [Title IX's] nondiscrimination mandate," even
in circumstances that would not give rise to a claim for money damages. See,
In an August 1998 letter to school superintendents and a January 1999 letter
to college and university presidents, the Secretary of Education informed school
officials that the Gebser decision did not change a school's obligations to
take reasonable steps under Title IX and the regulations to prevent and eliminate
sexual harassment as a condition of its receipt of Federal funding. The Department
also determined that, although in most important respects the substance of
the 1997 guidance was reaffirmed in Gebser and Davis , certain areas of the
1997 guidance could be strengthened by further clarification and explanation
On November 2, 2000, we published in the Federal Register a notice requesting
comments on the proposed revised guidance (62 FR 66092). A detailed explanation
of the Gebser and Davis decisions, and an explanation of the proposed changes
in the guidance, can be found in the preamble to the proposed revised guidance.
In those decisions and a third opinion, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,
Inc. ( Oncale ), 523 U.S. 75 (1998) (a sexual harassment case decided under
Title VII), the Supreme Court confirmed several fundamental principles we articulated
in the 1997 guidance. In these areas, no changes in the guidance were necessary.
A notice regarding the availability of this final document appeared in the
It continues to be the case that a significant number of students, both male
and female, have experienced sexual harassment, which can interfere with a
student's academic performance and emotional and physical well-being. Preventing
and remedying sexual harassment in schools is essential to ensuring a safe
environment in which students can learn. As with the 1997 guidance, the revised
guidance applies to students at every level of education. School personnel
who understand their obligations under Title IX, e.g., understand that sexual
harassment can be sex discrimination in violation of Title IX, are in the best
position to prevent harassment and to lessen the harm to students if, despite
One of the fundamental aims of both the 1997 guidance and the revised guidance
has been to emphasize that, in addressing allegations of sexual harassment,
the good judgment and common sense of teachers and school administrators are
important elements of a response that meets the requirements of Title IX.
A critical issue under Title IX is whether the school recognized that sexual
harassment has occurred and took prompt and effective action calculated to
end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its
effects. If harassment has occurred, doing nothing is always the wrong response.
However, depending on the circumstances, there may be more than one right way
to respond. The important thing is for school employees or officials to pay
attention to the school environment and not to hesitate to respond to sexual
harassment in the same reasonable, commonsense manner as they would to other
It is also important that schools not overreact to behavior that does not
rise to the level of sexual harassment. As the Department stated in the 1997
guidance, a kiss on the cheek by a first grader does not constitute sexual
harassment. School personnel should consider the age and maturity of students
Finally, we reiterate the importance of having well- publicized and effective
grievance procedures in place to handle complaints of sex discrimination, including
sexual harassment complaints. Nondiscrimination policies and procedures are
required by the Title IX regulations. In fact, the Supreme Court in Gebser
specifically affirmed the Department's authority to enforce this requirement
administratively in order to carry out Title IX's nondiscrimination mandate.
524 U.S. at 292. Strong policies and effective grievance procedures are essential
to let students and employees know that sexual harassment will not be tolerated
Analysis of Comments Received Concerning the Proposed Revised Guidance
In response to the Assistant Secretary's invitation to comment, OCR received
approximately 11 comments representing approximately 15 organizations and individuals.
Commenters provided specific suggestions regarding how the revised guidance
could be clarified. Many of these suggested changes have been incorporated.
Significant and recurring issues are grouped by subject and discussed in the
Distinction Between Administrative Enforcement and Private Litigation
In Gebser and Davis , the Supreme Court addressed for the first time the appropriate
standards for determining when a school district is liable under Title IX for
money damages in a private lawsuit brought by or on behalf of a student who
has been sexually harassed. As explained in the preamble to the proposed revised
guidance, the Court was explicit in Gebser and Davis that the liability standards
established in these cases are limited to private actions for monetary damages.
See, e.g., Gebser , 524 U.S. At 283, and Davis , 526 U.S. At 639. The Gebser  Court recognized and contrasted lawsuits for money damages with the incremental
nature of administrative enforcement of Title IX. In Gebser , the Court was
concerned with the possibility of a money damages award against a school for
harassment about which it had not known. In contrast, the process of administrative
enforcement requires enforcement agencies such as OCR to make schools aware
of potential Title IX violations and to seek voluntary corrective action before
Commenters uniformly agreed with OCR that the Court limited the liability
standards established in Gebser and Davis to private actions for monetary damages.
See, e.g., Gebser , 524 U.S. 283, and Davis , 526 U.S. At 639. Commenters
also agreed that the administrative enforcement standards reflected in the
Finally, commenters agreed that the proposed revisions provided important clarification
to schools regarding the standards that OCR will use and that schools should
use to determine compliance with Title IX as a condition of the receipt of
Most commenters agreed with OCR's interpretation of its regulations regarding
a school's responsibility for harassment of students by teachers and other
school employees. These commenters agreed that Title IX's prohibitions against
discrimination are not limited to official policies and practices governing
school programs and activities. A school also engages in sex-based discrimination
if its employees, in the context of carrying out their day-to-day job responsibilities
for providing aid, benefits, or services to students (such as teaching, counseling,
supervising, and advising students) deny or limit a student's ability to participate
in or benefit from the schools program on the basis of sex.' Under the Title
IX regulations, the school is responsible for discrimination in these cases,
whether or not it knew or should have known about it, because the discrimination
occurred as part of the school's undertaking to provide nondiscriminatory aid,
benefits, and services to students. The revised guidance distinguishes these
cases from employee harassment that, although taking place in a school's program,
occurs outside of the context of the employee's provision of aid, benefits,
and services to students. In these latter cases, the school's responsibilities
are not triggered until the school knew or should have known about the harassment.
One commenter expressed concern that it was inappropriate ever to find a school
out of compliance for harassment about which it knew nothing. We reiterate
that, although a school may in some cases be responsible for harassment caused
by an employee that occurred before other responsible employees of the school
knew or should have known about it, OCR always provides the school with actual
notice and the opportunity to take appropriate corrective action before issuing
a finding of violation. This is consistent with the Court's underlying concern
Most commenters acknowledged that OCR has provided useful factors to determine
whether harassing conduct took place "in the context of providing aid,
benefits, or services." However, some commenters stated that additional
clarity and examples regarding the issue were needed. Commenters also suggested
clarifying references to quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment as
these two concepts, though useful, do not determine the issue of whether the
school itself is considered responsible for the harassment. We agree with
these concerns and have made significant revisions to the sections "Harassment
that Denies or Limits a Student's Ability to Participate in or Benefit from
the Education Program" and "Harassment by Teachers and Other Employees" to
Gender-based Harassment, Including Harassment Predicated on Sex-stereotyping
Several commenters requested that we expand the discussion and include examples
of gender-based harassment predicated on sex stereotyping. Some commenters
also argued that gender-based harassment should be considered sexual harassment,
and that we have "artificially" restricted the guidance only to harassment
in the form of conduct of a sexual nature, thus, implying that gender-based
harassment is of less concern and should be evaluated differently.
We have not further expanded this section because, while we are also concerned
with the important issue of gender-based harassment, we believe that harassment
of a sexual nature raises unique and sufficiently important issues that distinguish
it from other types of gender-based harassment and warrants its own guidance.
Nevertheless, we have clarified this section of the guidance in several ways.
The guidance clarifies that gender-based harassment, including that predicated
on sex-stereotyping, is covered by Title IX if it is sufficiently serious to
deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the program.
Thus, it can be discrimination on the basis of sex to harass a student on the
basis of the victim's failure to conform to stereotyped notions of masculinity
and femininity. Although this type of harassment is not covered by the guidance,
if it is sufficiently serious, gender-based harassment is a school's responsibility,
and the same standards generally will apply. We have also added an endnote
regarding Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that sex stereotyping
Several commenters also suggested that we state that sexual and non-sexual
(but gender-based) harassment should not be evaluated separately in determining
whether a hostile environment exists. We note that both the proposed revised
guidance and the final revised guidance indicate in several places that incidents
of sexual harassment and non-sexual, gender-based harassment can be combined
to determine whether a hostile environment has been created. We also note
that sufficiently serious harassment of a sexual nature remains covered by
Title IX, as explained in the guidance, even though the hostile environment
One commenter urged OCR to provide distinct definitions of sexual harassment
to be used in administrative enforcement as distinguished from criteria used
to maintain private actions for monetary damages. We disagree. First, as
discussed in the preamble to the proposed revised guidance, the definition
of hostile environment sexual harassment used by the Court in Davis is consistent
with the definition found in the proposed guidance. Although the terms used
by the Court in Davis are in some ways different from the words used to define
hostile environment harassment in the 1997 guidance (see, e.g., 62 FR 12041, "conduct
of a sexual nature is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit
a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the education program,
or to create a hostile or abusive educational environment"), the definitions
are consistent. Both the Court's and the Department's definitions are contextual
descriptions intended to capture the same concept - that under Title IX, the
conduct must be sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student's
ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program. In determining
whether harassment is actionable, both Davis and the Department tell schools
to look at the "constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,
and relationships" (526 U.S. At 651 (citing Oncale )), and the Davis Court
cited approvingly to the underlying core factors described in the 1997 guidance
for evaluating the context of the harassment. Second, schools benefit from
consistency and simplicity in understanding what is sexual harassment for which
the school must take responsive action. A multiplicity of definitions would
Several commenters suggested that we develop a unique Title IX definition
of harassment that does not rely on Title VII and that takes into account the
special relationship of schools to students. Other commenters, by contrast,
commended OCR for recognizing that Gebser and Davis did not alter the definition
of hostile environment sexual harassment found in OCR's 1997 guidance, which
derives from Title VII caselaw, and asked us to strengthen the point. While
Gebser and Davis made clear that Title VII agency principles do not apply in
determining liability for money damages under Title IX, the Davis Court also
indicated, through its specific references to Title VII caselaw, that Title
VII remains relevant in determining what constitutes hostile environment sexual
harassment under Title IX. We also believe that the factors described in both
the 1997 guidance and the revised guidance to determine whether sexual harassment
has occurred provide the necessary flexibility for taking into consideration
the age and maturity of the students involved and the nature of the school
One commenter suggested that the change in the guidance from "appropriate
that requires omniscience of schools. We disagree. Effectiveness has always
been the measure of an adequate response under Title IX. This does not mean
a school must overreact out of fear of being judged inadequate. Effectiveness
is measured based on a reasonableness standard. Schools do not have to know
beforehand that their response will be effective. However, if their initial
steps are ineffective in stopping the harassment, reasonableness may require
In the development of both the 1997 guidance and the current revisions to
the guidance, commenters raised concerns about the interrelation of the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, and Title IX.
The concerns relate to two issues: (1) the harassed student's right to information
about the outcome of a sexual harassment complaint against another student,
including information about sanctions imposed on a student found guilty of
harassment; and (2) the due process rights of individuals, including teachers,
accused of sexual harassment by a student, to obtain information about the
FERPA generally forbids disclosure of information from a student's "education
record" without the consent of the student (or the student's parent).
Thus, FERPA may be relevant when the person found to have engaged in harassment
is another student, because written information about the complaint, investigation,
and outcome is part of the harassing student's education record. Title IX
is also relevant because it is an important part of taking effective responsive
action for the school to inform the harassed student of the results of its
investigation and whether it counseled, disciplined, or otherwise sanctioned
the harasser. This information can assure the harassed student that the school
has taken the student's complaint seriously and has taken steps to eliminate
the hostile environment and prevent the harassment from recurring.
The Department currently interprets FERPA as not conflicting with the Title
IX requirement that the school notify the harassed student of the outcome of
its investigation, i.e., whether or not harassment was found to have occurred,
because this information directly relates to the victim. It has been the Department's
position that there is a potential conflict between FERPA and Title IX regarding
disclosure of sanctions, and that FERPA generally prevents a school from disclosing
to a student who complained of harassment information about the sanction or
discipline imposed upon a student who was found to have engaged in that harassment. [3]
There is, however, an additional statutory provision that may apply to this
situation. In 1994, as part of the Improving America's Schools Act, Congress
amended the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) - of which FERPA is a
part - to state that nothing in GEPA "shall be construed to affect the
applicability of ... title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972...." [4]
The Department interprets this provision to mean that FERPA continues to apply
in the context of Title IX enforcement, but if there is a direct conflict between
requirements of FERPA and requirements of Title IX, such that enforcement of
FERPA would interfere with the primary purpose of Title IX to eliminate sex-based
discrimination in schools, the requirements of Title IX override any conflicting
FERPA provisions. The Department is in the process of developing a consistent
approach and specific factors for implementing this provision. OCR and the
Department's Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) intend to issue joint guidance,
discussing specific areas of potential conflict between FERPA and Title IX.
FERPA is also relevant when a student accuses a teacher or other employee
of sexual harassment, because written information about the allegations is
contained in the student's education record. The potential conflict arises
because, while FERPA protects the privacy of the student accuser, the accused
individual may need the name of the accuser and information regarding the nature
of the allegations in order to defend against the charges. The 1997 guidance
made clear that neither FERPA nor Title IX override any federally protected
due process rights of a school employee accused of sexual harassment.
Several commenters urged the Department to expand and strengthen this discussion.
They argue that in many instances a school's failure to provide information
about the name of the student accuser and the nature of the allegations seriously
undermines the fairness of the investigative and adjudicative process. They
also urge the Department to include a discussion of the need for confidentiality
as to the identity of the individual accused of harassment because of the significant
harm that can be caused by false accusations. We have made several changes
to the guidance, including an additional discussion regarding the confidentiality
of a person accused of harassment and a new heading entitled "Due Process

colleges, universities, and other educational institutions that receive Federal

a violation and seeking voluntary corrective action also would apply to private

an order that the harasser stay away from the harassed student), or sanctions

Act of 1973 (prohibiting disability-based discrimination by recipients) and
Response to Direct Observation of Harassment by a Responsible Employee
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) and the Department

The Supreme Court, Congress, and Federal executive departments and agencies,
including the Department, have recognized that sexual harassment of students

address sexual harassment of students as a condition of continued receipt of
Federal funding. It describes the regulatory basis for a school's compliance
responsibilities under Title IX, outlines the circumstances under which sexual
harassment may constitute discrimination prohibited by the statute and regulations,
and provides information about actions that schools should take to prevent
sexual harassment or to address it effectively if it does occur. [5]
Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment
can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
Sexual harassment of a student can deny or limit, on the basis of sex, the
student's ability to participate in or to receive benefits, services, or opportunities
in the school's program. Sexual harassment of students is, therefore, a form
of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX under the circumstances described
It is important to recognize that Title IX's prohibition against sexual harassment
does not extend to legitimate nonsexual touching or other nonsexual conduct.
For example, a high school athletic coach hugging a student who made a goal
or a kindergarten teacher's consoling hug for a child with a skinned knee will
Similarly, one student's demonstration of a sports maneuver or technique requiring
contact with another student will not be considered sexual harassment. However,
in some circumstances, nonsexual conduct may take on sexual connotations and
rise to the level of sexual harassment. For example, a teacher's repeatedly
hugging and putting his or her arms around students under inappropriate circumstances
Title IX applies to all public and private educational institutions that receive
Federal funds, i.e., recipients, including, but not limited to, elementary

to refer to all of those institutions. The "education program or activity" of
This means that Title IX protects students in connection with all of the academic,
educational, extra-curricular, athletic, and other programs of the school,
whether they take place in the facilities of the school, on a school bus, at
a class or training program sponsored by the school at another location, or
A student may be sexually harassed by a school employee, [9] another
student, or a non-employee third party (e.g., a visiting speaker or visiting
athletes). Title IX protects any "person" from sex discrimination.
Accordingly, both male and female students are protected from sexual harassment [10] engaged
in by a school's employees, other students, or third parties. Moreover, Title

harassment directed at gay or lesbian students that is sufficiently serious

school's program constitutes sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX under
For example, if a male student or a group of male students target a gay student
for physical sexual advances, serious enough to deny or limit the victim's
ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program, the school
would need to respond promptly and effectively, as described in this guidance,
just as it would if the victim were heterosexual. On the other hand, if students
heckle another student with comments based on the student's sexual orientation
(e.g., "gay students are not welcome at this table in the cafeteria"),
but their actions do not involve conduct of a sexual nature, their actions
Though beyond the scope of this guidance, gender-based harassment, which may
include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or
not involving conduct of a sexual nature, is also a form of sex discrimination
to which a school must respond, if it rises to a level that denies or limits
a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program. [17]
For example, the repeated sabotaging of female graduate students laboratory
experiments by male students in the class could be the basis of a violation
of Title IX. A school must respond to such harassment in accordance with the

harassment could create a hostile environment, even if neither the gender-based
harassment alone nor the sexual harassment alone would be sufficient to do
As a condition of receiving funds from the Department, a school is required
to comply with Title IX and the Department's Title IX regulations, which spell
out prohibitions against sex discrimination. The law is clear that sexual
Recipients specifically agree, as a condition for receiving Federal financial
assistance from the Department, to comply with Title IX and the Department's
Title IX regulations. The regulatory provision requiring this agreement, known
as an assurance of compliance, specifies that recipients must agree that education
programs or activities operated by the recipient will be operated in compliance
with the Title IX regulations, including taking any action necessary to remedy
its discrimination or the effects of its discrimination in its programs. [21]
The regulations set out the basic Title IX responsibilities a recipient undertakes
when it accepts Federal financial assistance, including the following specific

For the purposes of brevity and clarity, this guidance generally summarizes
this comprehensive list by referring to a school's obligation to ensure that
a student is not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit
The regulations also specify that, if a recipient discriminates on the basis
of sex, the school must take remedial action to overcome the effects of the
In addition, the regulations establish procedural requirements that are important
for the prevention or correction of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment.
These requirements include issuance of a policy against sex discrimination [30] and
adoption and publication of grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable
The regulations also require that recipients designate at least one employee
to coordinate compliance with the regulations, including coordination of investigations
To comply with these regulatory requirements, schools need to recognize and
respond to sexual harassment of students by teachers and other employees, by
other students, and by third parties. This guidance explains how the requirements
of the Title IX regulations apply to situations involving sexual harassment
of a student and outlines measures that schools should take to ensure compliance.
In assessing sexually harassing conduct, it is important for schools to recognize
that two distinct issues are considered. The first issue is whether, considering
the types of harassment discussed in the following section, the conduct denies
or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the program
based on sex.' If it does, the second issue is the nature of the school's responsibility
to address that conduct. As discussed in a following section, this issue depends
in part on the identity of the harasser and the context in which the harassment
This guidance moves away from specific labels for types of sexual harassment. [33]
In each case, the issue is whether the harassment rises to a level that it
denies or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the
school's program based on sex. However, an understanding of the different types
of sexual harassment can help schools determine whether or not harassment has
occurred that triggers a school's responsibilities under, or violates, Title
The type of harassment traditionally referred to as quid pro quo harassment
occurs if a teacher or other employee conditions an educational decision or
benefit on the student's submission to unwelcome sexual conduct. [34]
Whether the student resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and
avoids the threatened harm, the student has been treated differently, or the
student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program has
been denied or limited, on the basis of sex in violation of the Title IX regulations. [35]
By contrast, sexual harassment can occur that does not explicitly or implicitly
condition a decision or benefit on submission to sexual conduct. Harassment
of this type is generally referred to as hostile environment harassment. [36]
This type of harassing conduct requires a further assessment of whether or
not the conduct is sufficiently serious to deny or limit a student's ability
to participate in or benefit from the school's program based on sex. [37]
Teachers and other employees can engage in either type of harassment. Students
and third parties are not generally given responsibility over other students
and, thus, generally can only engage in hostile environment harassment.
As outlined in the following paragraphs, OCR considers a variety of related
factors to determine if a hostile environment has been created, i.e., if sexually
harassing conduct by an employee, another student, or a third party is sufficiently
serious that it denies or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit
from the school's program based on sex.' OCR considers the conduct from both
In evaluating the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct, OCR considers
all relevant circumstances, i.e., "the constellation of surrounding circumstances,
Schools should also use these factors to evaluate conduct in order to draw
commonsense distinctions between conduct that constitutes sexual harassment
and conduct that does not rise to that level. Relevant factors include the
The degree to which the conduct affected one or more students education.    OCR assesses the effect of the harassment on the student to determine whether
it has denied or limited the student's ability to participate in or benefit
from the school's program. For example, a student's grades may go down or
the student may be forced to withdraw from school because of the harassing
student may also suffer physical injuries or mental or emotional distress. [42]
In another situation, a student may have been able to keep up his or her
grades and continue to attend school even though it was very difficult for
him or her to do so because of the teacher's repeated sexual advances. Similarly,
a student may be able to remain on a sports team, despite experiencing great
difficulty performing at practices and games from the humiliation and anger
caused by repeated sexual advances and intimidation by several team members
that create a hostile environment. Harassing conduct in these examples would
alter a reasonable student's educational environment and adversely affect
the student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program
A hostile environment can occur even if the harassment is not targeted
For example, if a student, group of students, or a teacher regularly
directs sexual comments toward a particular student, a hostile environment
may be created not only for the targeted student, but also for others
The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct.  In most cases, a hostile
environment will exist if there is a pattern or practice of harassment, or
For instance, if a young woman is taunted by one or more young men about
her breasts or genital area or both, OCR may find that a hostile environment
has been created, particularly if the conduct has gone on for some time,
or takes place throughout the school, or if the taunts are made by a number
of students. The more severe the conduct, the less the need to show a repetitive
series of incidents; this is particularly true if the harassment is physical.
For instance, if the conduct is more severe, e.g., attempts to grab a female
student's breasts or attempts to grab any student's genital area or buttocks,
it need not be as persistent to create a hostile environment. Indeed, a single
or isolated incident of sexual harassment may, if sufficiently severe, create
On the other hand, conduct that is not severe will not create a hostile environment,
e.g., a comment by one student to another student that she has a nice figure.
Indeed, depending on the circumstances, this may not even be conduct of a
Similarly, because students date one another, a request for a date or a gift
of flowers, even if unwelcome, would not create a hostile environment. However,
there may be circumstances in which repeated, unwelcome requests for dates
or similar conduct could create a hostile environment. For example, a person,
who has been refused previously, may request dates in an intimidating or
The identity of and relationship between the alleged harasser and the subject
or subjects of the harassment.  A factor to be considered, especially in
cases involving allegations of sexual harassment of a student by a school
employee, is the identity of and relationship between the alleged harasser
and the subject or subjects of the harassment. For example, due to the power
a professor or teacher has over a student, sexually based conduct by that
person toward a student is more likely to create a hostile environment than
The number of individuals involved.  Sexual harassment may be committed
by an individual or a group. In some cases, verbal comments or other conduct
from one person might not be sufficient to create a hostile environment,
but could be if done by a group. Similarly, while harassment can be directed
effect of the conduct toward a group may vary, depending on the type of conduct
and the context. For certain types of conduct, there may be "safety
in numbers." For example, following an individual student and making
sexual taunts to him or her may be very intimidating to that student, but,
in certain circumstances, less so to a group of students. On the other hand,
persistent unwelcome sexual conduct still may create a hostile environment

of sexual harassment to determine if the incidents of sexual harassment are
sufficiently serious to create a sexually hostile environment. [52]
It is the totality of the circumstances in which the behavior occurs that
is critical in determining whether a hostile environment exists. Consequently,
in using the factors discussed previously to evaluate incidents of alleged
harassment, it is always important to use common sense and reasonable judgement
in determining whether a sexually hostile environment has been created.

Conduct is unwelcome if the student did not request or invite it and "regarded
Acquiescence in the conduct or the failure to complain does not always mean
For example, a student may decide not to resist sexual advances of another
student or may not file a complaint out of fear. In addition, a student may
not object to a pattern of demeaning comments directed at him or her by a group
of students out of a concern that objections might cause the harassers to make
more comments. The fact that a student may have accepted the conduct does
Also, the fact that a student willingly participated in conduct on one occasion
does not prevent him or her from indicating that the same conduct has become
unwelcome on a subsequent occasion. On the other hand, if a student actively
participates in sexual banter and discussions and gives no indication that
he or she objects, then the evidence generally will not support a conclusion
If younger children are involved, it may be necessary to determine the degree
to which they are able to recognize that certain sexual conduct is conduct
to which they can or should reasonably object and the degree to which they
can articulate an objection. Accordingly, OCR will consider the age of the
student, the nature of the conduct involved, and other relevant factors in
determining whether a student had the capacity to welcome sexual conduct.
Schools should be particularly concerned about the issue of welcomeness if
the harasser is in a position of authority. For instance, because students
may be encouraged to believe that a teacher has absolute authority over the
operation of his or her classroom, a student may not object to a teacher's
sexually harassing comments during class; however, this does not necessarily
mean that the conduct was welcome. Instead, the student may believe that any
objections would be ineffective in stopping the harassment or may fear that
by making objections he or she will be singled out for harassing comments or
In addition, OCR must consider particular issues of welcomeness if the alleged
harassment relates to alleged "consensual" sexual relationships between
a school's adult employees and its students. If elementary students are involved,
welcomeness will not be an issue: OCR will never view sexual conduct between
an adult school employee and an elementary school student as consensual. In
cases involving secondary students, there will be a strong presumption that
sexual conduct between an adult school employee and a student is not consensual.
In cases involving older secondary students, subject to the presumption, [57] OCR
will consider a number of factors in determining whether a school employee's
sexual advances or other sexual conduct could be considered welcome. [58]
In addition, OCR will consider these factors in all cases involving postsecondary

or her ability to do so. Similarly, certain types of disabilities could

would be welcome  determinations should be made based on the totality of
the circumstances. The following types of information may be helpful in resolving
Evidence about the relative credibility of the allegedly harassed student
and the alleged harasser. For example, the level of detail and consistency
of each person's account should be compared in an attempt to determine who
is telling the truth. Another way to assess credibility is to see if corroborative
evidence is lacking where it should logically exist. However, the absence
of witnesses may indicate only the unwillingness of others to step forward,
perhaps due to fear of the harasser or a desire not to get involved.
Evidence that the alleged harasser has been found to have harassed others
may support the credibility of the student claiming the harassment; conversely,
the student's claim will be weakened if he or she has been found to have
Evidence of the allegedly harassed student's reaction or behavior after
the alleged harassment. For example, were there witnesses who saw the student
immediately after the alleged incident who say that the student appeared
to be upset? However, it is important to note that some students may respond
to harassment in ways that do not manifest themselves right away, but may
surface several days or weeks after the harassment. For example, a student
may initially show no signs of having been harassed, but several weeks after
the harassment, there may be significant changes in the student's behavior,
including difficulty concentrating on academic work, symptoms of depression,
Evidence about whether the student claiming harassment filed a complaint
or took other action to protest the conduct soon after the alleged incident

Other contemporaneous evidence. For example, did the student claiming
harassment write about the conduct and his or her reaction to it soon after
it occurred (e.g., in a diary or letter)? Did the student tell others (friends,
parents) about the conduct (and his or her reaction to it) soon after it
A school has a responsibility to respond promptly and effectively to sexual
harassment. In the case of harassment by teachers or other employees, the nature
of this responsibility depends in part on whether the harassment occurred in
the context of the employee's provision of aid, benefits, or services to students.
Sexual harassment of a student by a teacher or other school employee can be
Schools are responsible for taking prompt and effective action to stop the
harassment and prevent its recurrence. A school also may be responsible for
remedying the effects of the harassment on the student who was harassed. The
extent of a recipient's responsibilities if an employee sexually harasses a
student is determined by whether or not the harassment occurred in the context
of the employee's provision of aid, benefits, or services to students.
A recipient is responsible under the Title IX regulations for the nondiscriminatory
provision of aid, benefits, and services to students. Recipients generally
provide aid, benefits, and services to students through the responsibilities
they give to employees. If an employee who is acting (or who reasonably appears
to be acting) in the context of carrying out these responsibilities over students
engages in sexual harassment  generally this means harassment that is carried
out during an employee's performance of his or her responsibilities in relation
to students, including teaching, counseling, supervising, advising, and transporting
students  and the harassment denies or limits a student's ability to participate
The recipient is, therefore, also responsible for remedying any effects of
the harassment on the victim, as well as for ending the harassment and preventing
its recurrence. This is true whether or not the recipient has "notice" of
the harassment. (As explained in the section on "Notice of Employee,
Peer, or Third Party Harassment," for purposes of this guidance, a school
has notice of harassment if a responsible school employee actually knew or,
in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known about the harassment.)
Of course, under OCR's administrative enforcement, recipients always receive
actual notice and the opportunity to take appropriate corrective action before
Whether or not sexual harassment of a student occurred within the context
of an employee's responsibilities for providing aid, benefits, or services
is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a variety of factors.
If an employee conditions the provision of an aid, benefit, or service that
the employee is responsible for providing on a student's submission to sexual
conduct, i.e., conduct traditionally referred to as quid pro quo harassment,
the harassment is clearly taking place in the context of the employee's responsibilities
to provide aid, benefits, or services." In other situations, i.e., when
an employee has created a hostile environment, OCR will consider the following
factors in determining whether or not the harassment has taken place in this
The type and degree of responsibility given to the employee, including
both formal and informal authority, to provide aids, benefits, or services
to students, to direct and control student conduct, or to discipline students
the degree of influence the employee has over the particular student involved,
including in the circumstances in which the harassment took place;
as applicable, whether, in light of the student's age and educational level
and the way the school is run, it would be reasonable for the student to
believe that the employee was in a position of responsibility over the student,
These factors are applicable to all recipient educational institutions, including
elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities. Elementary and
secondary schools, however, are typically run in a way that gives teachers,
school officials, and other school employees a substantial degree of supervision,
control, and disciplinary authority over the conduct of students. [63]
Therefore, in cases involving allegations of harassment of elementary and
secondary school-age students by a teacher or school administrator during any
of these factors will generally lead to a conclusion that the harassment occurred
in the context of the employee's provision of aid, benefits, or services.
For example, a teacher sexually harasses an eighth- grade student in a school
hallway. Even if the student is not in any of the teacher's classes and even
if the teacher is not designated as a hall monitor, given the age and educational
level of the student and the status and degree of influence of teachers in
elementary and secondary schools, it would be reasonable for the student to
believe that the teacher had at least informal disciplinary authority over
students in the hallways. Thus, OCR would consider this an example of conduct
that is occurring in the context of the employee's responsibilities to provide
Other examples of sexual harassment of a student occurring in the context
of an employee's responsibilities for providing aid, benefits, or services
include, but are not limited to -- a faculty member at a university's medical
school conditions an intern's evaluation on submission to his sexual advances
and then gives her a poor evaluation for rejecting the advances; a high school
drama instructor does not give a student a part in a play because she has not
responded to sexual overtures from the instructor; a faculty member withdraws
approval of research funds for her assistant because he has rebuffed her advances;
a journalism professor who supervises a college newspaper continually and inappropriately
touches a student editor in a sexual manner, causing the student to resign
from the newspaper staff; and a teacher repeatedly asks a ninth grade student
to stay after class and attempts to engage her in discussions about sex and
her personal experiences while they are alone in the classroom, causing the
student to stop coming to class. In each of these cases, the school is responsible
for the discriminatory conduct, including taking prompt and effective action
to end the harassment, prevent it from recurring, and remedy the effects of
Sometimes harassment of a student by an employee in the school's program does
not take place in the context of the employee's provision of aid, benefits,
or services, but nevertheless is sufficiently serious to create a hostile educational
environment. An example of this conduct might occur if a faculty member in
the history department at a university, over the course of several weeks, repeatedly
touches and makes sexually suggestive remarks to a graduate engineering student
while waiting at a stop for the university shuttle bus, riding on the bus,
and upon exiting the bus. As a result, the student stops using the campus
shuttle and walks the very long distances between her classes. In this case,
the school is not directly responsible for the harassing conduct because it
did not occur in the context of the employee's responsibilities for the provision
of aid, benefits, or services to students. However, the conduct is sufficiently
serious to deny or limit the student in her ability to participate in or benefit
from the recipient's program. Thus, the school has a duty, upon notice of
take prompt and effective action to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence.
If the school takes these steps, it has avoided violating Title IX. If the
school fails to take the necessary steps, however, its failure to act has allowed
the student to continue to be subjected to a hostile environment that denies
or limits the student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's
program. The school, therefore, has engaged in its own discrimination. It
then becomes responsible, not just for stopping the conduct and preventing
it from happening again, but for remedying the effects of the harassment on
the student that could reasonably have been prevented if the school had responded
promptly and effectively. (For related issues, see the sections on "OCR
If a student sexually harasses another student and the harassing conduct is
sufficiently serious to deny or limit the student's ability to participate

harassment, the school is responsible for taking immediate effective action
to eliminate the hostile environment and prevent its recurrence. [67]
As long as the school, upon notice of the harassment, responds by taking prompt
and effective action to end the harassment and prevent its recurrence, the
school has carried out its responsibility under the Title IX regulations.
On the other hand, if, upon notice, the school fails to take prompt, effective
action, the school's own inaction has permitted the student to be subjected
to a hostile environment that denies or limits the student's ability to participate
In this case, the school is responsible for taking effective corrective actions
to stop the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects on the
victim that could reasonably have been prevented had it responded promptly
Similarly, sexually harassing conduct by third parties, who are not themselves
employees or students at the school (e.g., a visiting speaker or members of
a visiting athletic team), may also be of a sufficiently serious nature to
deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the education
program. As previously outlined in connection with peer harassment, if the
the harassment, the school is responsible for taking prompt and effective action
The type of appropriate steps that the school should take will differ depending
on the level of control that the school has over the third party harasser. [70]
For example, if athletes from a visiting team harass the home school's students,
the home school may not be able to discipline the athletes. However, it could
encourage the other school to take appropriate action to prevent further incidents;
if necessary, the home school may choose not to invite the other school back.
(This issue is discussed more fully in the section on "Recipient's Response.")
If, upon notice, the school fails to take prompt and effective corrective
action, its own failure has permitted the student to be subjected to a hostile
environment that limits the student's ability to participate in or benefit
In this case, the school is responsible for taking corrective actions to stop
the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects on the victim
that could reasonably have been prevented had the school responded promptly
As described in the section on "Harassment by Teachers and Other Employees," schools
may be responsible for certain types of employee harassment that occurred before
the school otherwise had notice of the harassment. On the other hand, as described
in that section and the section on "Harassment by Other Students or Third
Parties," in situations involving certain other types of employee harassment,
or harassment by peers or third parties, a school will be in violation of the
Title IX regulations if the school "has notice" of a sexually hostile
environment and fails to take immediate and effective corrective action. [72]
A school has notice if a responsible employee "knew, or in the exercise
A responsible employee would include any employee who has the authority to
take action to redress the harassment, who has the duty to report to appropriate
school officials sexual harassment or any other misconduct by students or employees,
or an individual who a student could reasonably believe has this authority
Accordingly, schools need to ensure that employees are trained so that those
with authority to address harassment know how to respond appropriately, and
other responsible employees know that they are obligated to report harassment
to appropriate school officials. Training for employees should include practical
information about how to identify harassment and, as applicable, the person
A school can receive notice of harassment in many different ways. A student
complained to a teacher or other responsible employee about fellow students
harassing him or her. A student, parent, or other individual may have contacted
other appropriate personnel, such as a principal, campus security, bus driver,
teacher, affirmative action officer, or staff in the office of student affairs.
A teacher or other responsible employee of the school may have witnessed the
harassment. The school may receive notice about harassment in an indirect
manner, from sources such as a member of the school staff, a member of the
educational or local community, or the media. The school also may have learned
about the harassment from flyers about the incident distributed at the school
or posted around the school. For the purposes of compliance with the Title
IX regulations, a school has a duty to respond to harassment about which it
reasonably should have known, i.e., if it would have learned of the harassment
if it had exercised reasonable care or made a "reasonably diligent inquiry." [76]
For example, in some situations if the school knows of incidents of harassment,
the exercise of reasonable care should trigger an investigation that would
In other cases, the pervasiveness of the harassment may be enough to conclude
that the school should have known of the hostile environment if the harassment
is widespread, openly practiced, or well-known to students and staff (such
as sexual harassment occurring in the hallways, graffiti in public areas, or
harassment occurring during recess under a teacher's supervision.) [78]
If a school otherwise knows or reasonably should know of a hostile environment
and fails to take prompt and effective corrective action, a school has violated
Title IX even if the student has failed to use the school's existing grievance
Schools are required by the Title IX regulations to adopt and publish grievance
procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination
complaints, including complaints of sexual harassment, and to disseminate a
(These issues are discussed in the section on "Prompt and Equitable Grievance
Procedures.") These procedures provide a school with a mechanism for
discovering sexual harassment as early as possible and for effectively correcting
problems, as required by the Title IX regulations. By having a strong policy
against sex discrimination and accessible, effective, and fairly applied grievance
procedures, a school is telling its students that it does not tolerate sexual
harassment and that students can report it without fear of adverse consequences.
Without a disseminated policy and procedure, a student does not know either
of the school's policy against and obligation to address this form of discrimination,
or how to report harassment so that it can be remedied. If the alleged harassment
is sufficiently serious to create a hostile environment and it is the school's
failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the Title IX regulations
that hampers early notification and intervention and permits sexual harassment
to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the
school will be responsible under the Title IX regulations, once informed of
the harassment, to take corrective action, including stopping the harassment,
preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects of the harassment on the
victim that could reasonably have been prevented if the school's failure to
comply with the procedural requirements had not hampered early notification.
If OCR is asked to investigate or otherwise resolve incidents of sexual harassment
of students, including incidents caused by employees, other students, or third
parties, OCR will consider whether  (1) the school has a disseminated policy
the school appropriately investigated or otherwise responded to allegations
(3) the school has taken immediate and effective corrective action responsive
to the harassment, including effective actions to end the harassment, prevent
(Issues related to appropriate investigative and corrective actions are discussed
If the school has taken, or agrees to take, each of these steps, OCR will
consider the case against the school resolved and will take no further action,
other than monitoring compliance with an agreement, if any, between the school
and OCR. This is true in cases in which the school was in violation of the
Title IX regulations (e.g., a teacher sexually harassed a student in the context
of providing aid, benefits, or services to students), as well as those in which
there has been no violation of the regulations (e.g., in a peer sexual harassment
situation in which the school took immediate, reasonable steps to end the harassment
and prevent its recurrence). This is because, even if OCR identifies a violation,
Title IX requires OCR to attempt to secure voluntary compliance. [85]
Thus, because a school will have the opportunity to take reasonable corrective
action before OCR issues a formal finding of violation, a school does not risk
losing its Federal funding solely because discrimination occurred.
Once a school has notice of possible sexual harassment of students  whether
carried out by employees, other students, or third parties  it should take
immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise determine what
occurred and take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end any
harassment, eliminate a hostile environment if one has been created, and prevent
harassment from occurring again. These steps are the school's responsibility
whether or not the student who was harassed makes a complaint or otherwise
As described in the next section, in appropriate circumstances the school will
also be responsible for taking steps to remedy the effects of the harassment
on the individual student or students who were harassed. What constitutes

of Harassment; Response to Direct Observation of Harassment by a Responsible
If a student or the parent of an elementary or secondary student provides
information or complains about sexual harassment of the student, the school
should initially discuss what actions the student or parent is seeking in response
to the harassment. The school should explain the avenues for informal and
formal action, including a description of the grievance procedure that is available
for sexual harassment complaints and an explanation of how the procedure works.
If a responsible school employee has directly observed sexual harassment of
a student, the school should contact the student who was harassed (or the parent,
that the school is responsible for taking steps to correct the harassment,
and provide the same information described in the previous sentence.
Regardless of whether the student who was harassed, or his or her parent,
decides to file a formal complaint or otherwise request action on the student's
behalf (including in cases involving direct observation by a responsible employee),
the school must promptly investigate to determine what occurred and then take
appropriate steps to resolve the situation. The specific steps in an investigation
will vary depending upon the nature of the allegations, the source of the complaint,
the age of the student or students involved, the size and administrative structure
of the school, and other factors. However, in all cases the inquiry must be
prompt, thorough, and impartial. (Requests by the student who was harassed
for confidentiality or for no action to be taken, responding to notice of harassment
from other sources, and the components of a prompt and equitable grievance
It may be appropriate for a school to take interim measures during the investigation
of a complaint. For instance, if a student alleges that he or she has been
sexually assaulted by another student, the school may decide to place the students
immediately in separate classes or in different housing arrangements on a campus,
pending the results of the school's investigation. Similarly, if the alleged
harasser is a teacher, allowing the student to transfer to a different class
may be appropriate. In cases involving potential criminal conduct, school
personnel should determine whether appropriate law enforcement authorities
should be notified. In all cases, schools should make every effort to prevent
disclosure of the names of all parties involved - the complainant, the witnesses,
and the accused -- except to the extent necessary to carry out an investigation.
If a school determines that sexual harassment has occurred, it should take
reasonable, timely, age-appropriate, and effective corrective action, including
Appropriate steps should be taken to end the harassment. For example, school
personnel may need to counsel, warn, or take disciplinary action against the
harasser, based on the severity of the harassment or any record of prior incidents
of escalating consequences may be necessary if the initial steps are ineffective
In some cases, it may be appropriate to further separate the harassed student
directing the harasser to have no further contact with the harassed student.
Responsive measures of this type should be designed to minimize, as much as
possible, the burden on the student who was harassed. If the alleged harasser
is not a student or employee of the recipient, OCR will consider the level
of control the school has over the harasser in determining what response would
Steps should also be taken to eliminate any hostile environment that has been
created. For example, if a female student has been subjected to harassment
by a group of other students in a class, the school may need to deliver special
training or other interventions for that class to repair the educational environment.
If the school offers the student the option of withdrawing from a class in
which a hostile environment occurred, the school should assist the student
in making program or schedule changes and ensure that none of the changes adversely
affect the student's academic record. Other measures may include, if appropriate,
directing a harasser to apologize to the harassed student. If a hostile environment
has affected an entire school or campus, an effective response may need to
include dissemination of information, the issuance of new policy statements,
or other steps that are designed to clearly communicate the message that the
school does not tolerate harassment and will be responsive to any student who
In some situations, a school may be required to provide other services to
the student who was harassed if necessary to address the effects of the harassment
For example, if an instructor gives a student a low grade because the student
failed to respond to his sexual advances, the school may be required to make
arrangements for an independent reassessment of the student's work, if feasible,
and change the grade accordingly; make arrangements for the student to take
the course again with a different instructor; provide tutoring; make tuition
adjustments; offer reimbursement for professional counseling; or take other
measures that are appropriate to the circumstances. As another example, if
a school delays responding or responds inappropriately to information about
harassment, such as a case in which the school ignores complaints by a student
that he or she is being sexually harassed by a classmate, the school will be
required to remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented
Finally, a school should take steps to prevent any further harassment [94] and
to prevent any retaliation against the student who made the complaint (or was
the subject of the harassment), against the person who filed a complaint on
behalf of a student, or against those who provided information as witnesses. [95]
At a minimum, this includes making sure that the harassed students and their
parents know how to report any subsequent problems and making follow-up inquiries
to see if there have been any new incidents or any retaliation. To prevent
recurrences, counseling for the harasser may be appropriate to ensure that
he or she understands what constitutes harassment and the effects it can have.
In addition, depending on how widespread the harassment was and whether there
have been any prior incidents, the school may need to provide training for
the larger school community to ensure that students, parents, and teachers
can recognize harassment if it recurs and know how to respond. [96]
The scope of a reasonable response also may depend upon whether a student,
or parent of a minor student, reporting harassment asks that the student's
name not be disclosed to the harasser or that nothing be done about the alleged
harassment. In all cases, a school should discuss confidentiality standards
and concerns with the complainant initially. The school should inform the
student that a confidentiality request may limit the school's ability to respond.
The school also should tell the student that Title IX prohibits retaliation
and that, if he or she is afraid of reprisals from the alleged harasser, the
school will take steps to prevent retaliation and will take strong responsive
actions if retaliation occurs. If the student continues to ask that his or
her name not be revealed, the school should take all reasonable steps to investigate
and respond to the complaint consistent with the student's request as long
as doing so does not prevent the school from responding effectively to the
OCR enforces Title IX consistent with the federally protected due process
rights of public school students and employees. Thus, for example, if a student,
who was the only student harassed, insists that his or her name not be revealed,
and the alleged harasser could not respond to the charges of sexual harassment
without that information, in evaluating the school's response, OCR would not
At the same time, a school should evaluate the confidentiality request in
the context of its responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment
for all students. The factors that a school may consider in this regard include
the seriousness of the alleged harassment, the age of the student harassed,
whether there have been other complaints or reports of harassment against the
alleged harasser, and the rights of the accused individual to receive information
about the accuser and the allegations if a formal proceeding with sanctions
Similarly, a school should be aware of the confidentiality concerns of an
accused employee or student. Publicized accusations of sexual harassment, if
ultimately found to be false, may nevertheless irreparably damage the reputation
of the accused. The accused individual's need for confidentiality must, of
course, also be evaluated based on the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph
in the context of the school's responsibility to ensure a safe environment
Although a student's request to have his or her name withheld may limit the
school's ability to respond fully to an individual complaint of harassment,
other means may be available to address the harassment. There are steps a
recipient can take to limit the effects of the alleged harassment and prevent
its recurrence without initiating formal action against the alleged harasser
or revealing the identity of the complainant. Examples include conducting
sexual harassment training for the school site or academic department where
the problem occurred, taking a student survey concerning any problems with
harassment, or implementing other systemic measures at the site or department
In addition, by investigating the complaint to the extent possible  including
by reporting it to the Title IX coordinator or other responsible school employee
designated pursuant to Title IX  the school may learn about or be able to
confirm a pattern of harassment based on claims by different students that
they were harassed by the same individual. In some situations there may be
prior reports by former students who now might be willing to come forward and
be identified, thus providing a basis for further corrective action. In instances
affecting a number of students (for example, a report from a student that an
instructor has repeatedly made sexually explicit remarks about his or her personal
life in front of an entire class), an individual can be put on notice of allegations
of harassing behavior and counseled appropriately without revealing, even indirectly,
the identity of the student who notified the school. Those steps can be very
The previous two sections deal with situations in which a student or parent
of a student who was harassed reports or complains of harassment or in which
a responsible school employee directly observes sexual harassment of a student.
If a school learns of harassment through other means, for example, if information
about harassment is received from a third party (such as from a witness to
an incident or an anonymous letter or telephone call), different factors will
affect the school's response. These factors include the source and nature
of the information; the seriousness of the alleged incident; the specificity
of the information; the objectivity and credibility of the source of the report;
whether any individuals can be identified who were subjected to the alleged
harassment; and whether those individuals want to pursue the matter. If, based
on these factors, it is reasonable for the school to investigate and it can
confirm the allegations, the considerations described in the previous sections
concerning interim measures and appropriate responsive action will apply.
For example, if a parent visiting a school observes a student repeatedly harassing
a group of female students and reports this to school officials, school personnel
can speak with the female students to confirm whether that conduct has occurred
and whether they view it as unwelcome. If the school determines that the conduct
created a hostile environment, it can take reasonable, age-appropriate steps
to address the situation. If on the other hand, the students in this example
were to ask that their names not be disclosed or indicate that they do not
want to pursue the matter, the considerations described in the previous section
related to requests for confidentiality will shape the school's response.
In a contrasting example, a student newspaper at a large university may print
an anonymous letter claiming that a professor is sexually harassing students
in class on a daily basis, but the letter provides no clue as to the identity
of the professor or the department in which the conduct is allegedly taking
place. Due to the anonymous source and lack of specificity of the information,
a school would not reasonably be able to investigate and confirm these allegations.
However, in response to the anonymous letter, the school could submit a letter
or article to the newspaper reiterating its policy against sexual harassment,
encouraging persons who believe that they have been sexually harassed to come
A policy specifically prohibiting sexual harassment and separate grievance
procedures for violations of that policy can help ensure that all students
and employees understand the nature of sexual harassment and that the school
will not tolerate it. Indeed, they might even bring conduct of a sexual nature
to the school's attention so that the school can address it before it becomes
sufficiently serious as to create a hostile environment. Further, training
for administrators, teachers, and staff and age-appropriate classroom information
for students can help to ensure that they understand what types of conduct
Schools are required by the Title IX regulations to adopt and publish a policy
against sex discrimination and grievance procedures providing for prompt and
equitable resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex. [98]
Accordingly, regardless of whether harassment occurred, a school violates this
requirement of the Title IX regulations if it does not have those procedures
A school's sex discrimination grievance procedures must apply to complaints
of sex discrimination in the school's education programs and activities filed
by students against school employees, other students, or third parties. [100]
Title IX does not require a school to adopt a policy specifically prohibiting
sexual harassment or to provide separate grievance procedures for sexual harassment
complaints. However, its nondiscrimination policy and grievance procedures
for handling discrimination complaints must provide effective means for preventing
and responding to sexual harassment. Thus, if, because of the lack of a policy
or procedure specifically addressing sexual harassment, students are unaware
of what kind of conduct constitutes sexual harassment or that such conduct
is prohibited sex discrimination, a school's general policy and procedures
relating to sex discrimination complaints will not be considered effective. [101]
OCR has identified a number of elements in evaluating whether a school's grievance
procedures are prompt and equitable, including whether the procedures provide
Notice to students, parents of elementary and secondary students, and employees
Application of the procedure to complaints alleging harassment carried

Designated and reasonably prompt timeframes for the major stages of the
An assurance that the school will take steps to prevent recurrence of any
harassment and to correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and
Many schools also provide an opportunity to appeal the findings or remedy,
or both. In addition, because retaliation is prohibited by Title IX, schools
may want to include a provision in their procedures prohibiting retaliation
against any individual who files a complaint or participates in a harassment
Procedures adopted by schools will vary considerably in detail, specificity,
and components, reflecting differences in audiences, school sizes and administrative
structures, State or local legal requirements, and past experience. In addition,
whether complaint resolutions are timely will vary depending on the complexity
of the investigation and the severity and extent of the harassment. During
the investigation it is a good practice for schools to inform students who
have alleged harassment about the status of the investigation on a periodic
A grievance procedure applicable to sexual harassment complaints cannot be
prompt or equitable unless students know it exists, how it works, and how to
file a complaint. Thus, the procedures should be written in language appropriate
to the age of the school's students, easily understood, and widely disseminated.
Distributing the procedures to administrators, or including them in the school's
administrative or policy manual, may not by itself be an effective way of providing
notice, as these publications are usually not widely circulated to and understood
by all members of the school community. Many schools ensure adequate notice
to students by having copies of the procedures available at various locations
throughout the school or campus; publishing the procedures as a separate document;
including a summary of the procedures in major publications issued by the school,
such as handbooks and catalogs for students, parents of elementary and secondary
students, faculty, and staff; and identifying individuals who can explain how
A school must designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to
The school must notify all of its students and employees of the name, office
address, and telephone number of the employee or employees designated. [105]
Because it is possible that an employee designated to handle Title IX complaints
may himself or herself engage in harassment, a school may want to designate
more than one employee to be responsible for handling complaints in order to
ensure that students have an effective means of reporting harassment. [106]
While a school may choose to have a number of employees responsible for Title
IX matters, it is also advisable to give one official responsibility for overall
coordination and oversight of all sexual harassment complaints to ensure consistent
practices and standards in handling complaints. Coordination of recordkeeping
(for instance, in a confidential log maintained by the Title IX coordinator)
will also ensure that the school can and will resolve recurring problems and
identify students or employees who have multiple complaints filed against them. [107]
Finally, the school must make sure that all designated employees have adequate
training as to what conduct constitutes sexual harassment and are able to explain
Grievance procedures may include informal mechanisms for resolving sexual
harassment complaints to be used if the parties agree to do so. [109]
OCR has frequently advised schools, however, that it is not appropriate for
a student who is complaining of harassment to be required to work out the problem
directly with the individual alleged to be harassing him or her, and certainly
not without appropriate involvement by the school (e.g., participation by a
counselor, trained mediator, or, if appropriate, a teacher or administrator).
In addition, the complainant must be notified of the right to end the informal
process at any time and begin the formal stage of the complaint process. In
some cases, such as alleged sexual assaults, mediation will not be appropriate
even on a voluntary basis. Title IX also permits the use of a student disciplinary
procedure not designed specifically for Title IX grievances to resolve sex
discrimination complaints, as long as the procedure meets the requirement of
affording a complainant a "prompt and equitable" resolution of the
In some instances, a complainant may allege harassing conduct that constitutes
both sex discrimination and possible criminal conduct. Police investigations
or reports may be useful in terms of fact gathering. However, because legal
standards for criminal investigations are different, police investigations
or reports may not be determinative of whether harassment occurred under Title
IX and do not relieve the school of its duty to respond promptly and effectively. [110]
Similarly, schools are cautioned about using the results of insurance company
investigations of sexual harassment allegations. The purpose of an insurance
investigation is to assess liability under the insurance policy, and the applicable
standards may well be different from those under Title IX. In addition, a
school is not relieved of its responsibility to respond to a sexual harassment
complaint filed under its grievance procedure by the fact that a complaint
A public school's employees have certain due process rights under the United
States Constitution. The Constitution also guarantees due process to students
in public and State-supported schools who are accused of certain types of infractions.
The rights established under Title IX must be interpreted consistent with any
federally guaranteed due process rights involved in a complaint proceeding.
Furthermore, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) does not
override federally protected due process rights of persons accused of sexual
harassment. Procedures that ensure the Title IX rights of the complainant,
while at the same time according due process to both parties involved, will
lead to sound and supportable decisions. Of course, schools should ensure
that steps to accord due process rights do not restrict or unnecessarily delay
the protections provided by Title IX to the complainant. In both public and
private schools, additional or separate rights may be created for employees
or students by State law, institutional regulations and policies, such as faculty
or student handbooks, and collective bargaining agreements. Schools should
be aware of these rights and their legal responsibilities to individuals accused
In cases of alleged harassment, the protections of the First Amendment must
be considered if issues of speech or expression are involved. [112]
Free speech rights apply in the classroom (e.g., classroom lectures and discussions) [113] and
in all other education programs and activities of public schools (e.g., public
meetings and speakers on campus; campus debates, school plays and other cultural
In addition, First Amendment rights apply to the speech of students and teachers. [116]
Title IX is intended to protect students from sex discrimination, not to regulate
the content of speech. OCR recognizes that the offensiveness of a particular
expression as perceived by some students, standing alone, is not a legally
sufficient basis to establish a sexually hostile environment under Title IX. [117]
In order to establish a violation of Title IX, the harassment must be sufficiently
serious to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from
Moreover, in regulating the conduct of its students and its faculty to prevent
or redress discrimination prohibited by Title IX (e.g., in responding to harassment
that is sufficiently serious as to create a hostile environment), a school
must formulate, interpret, and apply its rules so as to protect academic freedom
and free speech rights. For instance, while the First Amendment may prohibit
a school from restricting the right of students to express opinions about one
sex that may be considered derogatory, the school can take steps to denounce
those opinions and ensure that competing views are heard. The age of the students
involved and the location or forum may affect how the school can respond consistently
As an example of the application of free speech rights to allegations of sexual
Example 1:  In a college level creative writing class, a professor's required
reading list includes excerpts from literary classics that contain descriptions
of explicit sexual conduct, including scenes that depict women in submissive
and demeaning roles. The professor also assigns students to write their own
materials, which are read in class. Some of the student essays contain sexually
derogatory themes about women. Several female students complain to the Dean
of Students that the materials and related classroom discussion have created
a sexually hostile environment for women in the class. What must the school
Answer:  Academic discourse in this example is protected by the First Amendment
even if it is offensive to individuals. Thus, Title IX would not require the
school to discipline the professor or to censor the reading list or related
Example 2:  A group of male students repeatedly targets a female student
for harassment during the bus ride home from school, including making explicit
sexual comments about her body, passing around drawings that depict her engaging
in sexual conduct, and, on several occasions, attempting to follow her home
off the bus. The female student and her parents complain to the principal
that the male students conduct has created a hostile environment for girls
on the bus and that they fear for their daughter's safety. What must a school
Answer:  Threatening and intimidating actions targeted at a particular student
or group of students, even though they contain elements of speech, are not

by Title IX. 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; 34 CFR part 106, subpart E. If employees

Filed Against Recipients of Federal Financial Assistance. 28 CFR 42.604.

originally stated in its 1997 guidance, that Title IX prohibits sexual harassment
regardless of whether the harasser and the person being harassed are members
of the same sex.' 62 FR 12039. See also Kinman v. Omaha Public School Dist., 94 F.3d 463, 468 (8 th Cir. 1996), rev'd on other grounds, 171 F.3d 607

It can also occur in certain situations if the harassment is directed at students
of both sexes. Chiapuzo v. BLT Operating Corp., 826 F.Supp. 1334, 1337 (D.Wyo.
1993) (court found that if males and females were subject to harassment, but
harassment was based on sex, it could violate Title VII); but see Holman v.
Indiana, 211 F.3d 399, 405 (7th Cir. 2000) (if male and female both subjected
In many circumstances, harassing conduct will be on the basis of sex because
the student would not have been subjected to it at all had he or she been a
member of the opposite sex; e.g., if a female student is repeatedly propositioned
by a male student or employee (or, for that matter, if a male student is repeatedly
propositioned by a male student or employee.) In other circumstances, harassing
conduct will be on the basis of sex if the student would not have been affected
by it in the same way or to the same extent had he or she been a member of
the opposite sex; e.g., pornography and sexually explicit jokes in a mostly
male shop class are likely to affect the few girls in the class more than it

the student's sex was a factor in or affected the nature of the harasser's
conduct or both. Thus, in Chiapuzo, a supervisor made demeaning remarks to
both partners of a married couple working for him, e.g., as to sexual acts
he wanted to engage in with the wife and how he would be a better lover than
the husband. In both cases, according to the court, the remarks were based
on sex in that they were made with an intent to demean each member of the couple
because of his or her respective sex.' 826 F.Supp. at 1337. See also Steiner

OCR's longstanding interpretation of its regulations is that sexual harassment
may constitute a violation. 34 CFR 106.31; See Sexual Harassment Guidance,
62 FR 12034 (1997). When Congress enacted the Civil Rights Restoration Act
of 1987 to amend Title IX to restore institution-wide coverage over federally
assisted education programs and activities, the legislative history indicated
not only that Congress was aware that OCR interpreted its Title IX regulations
to prohibit sexual harassment, but also that one of the reasons for passing
the Restoration Act was to enable OCR to investigate and resolve cases involving
allegations of sexual harassment. S. REP. NO. 64, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.
at 12 (1987). The examples of discrimination that Congress intended to be
remedied by its statutory change included sexual harassment of students by
professors, id. at 14, and these examples demonstrate congressional recognition
that discrimination in violation of Title IX can be carried out by school employees
who are providing aid, benefits, or services to students. Congress also intended
that if discrimination occurred, recipients needed to implement effective remedies.
regulatory requirements. 34 CFR 106.31(a)(b). Depending upon the facts, sexual
harassment may also be prohibited by more specific regulatory prohibitions.
For example, if a college financial aid director told a student that she would
not get the student financial assistance for which she qualified unless she
slept with him, that also would be covered by the regulatory provision prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of sex in financial assistance, 34 CFR 106.37(a).

Sexual Harassment: It's Not Academic
Sexual harassment of students is illegal. A federal  law, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX),  prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment, in  education programs and activities. All public and private education  institutions that receive any federal funds must comply with Title IX. Title IX protects students from harassment connected to any of the  academic, educational, extracurricular, athletic, and other programs or  activities of schools, regardless of the location. Title IX protects  both male and female students from sexual harassment by any school employee,  another student, or a non-employee third party.
Preventing and remedying sexual harassment in schools is  essential to ensure a nondiscriminatory, safe environment in which students can  learn. Unfortunately, students, parents, and school staff may not know what  sexual harassment is, how to stop it, and what can be done to prevent it from happening.  This pamphlet uses a question-and-answer format to provide students, parents,  school administrators, school employees, and others with fundamental  information on recognizing and addressing sexual harassment under Title IX as it is interpreted by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil  Rights (OCR). OCR is the federal agency responsible for enforcing Title IX in schools that receive federal funds from the U.S. Department of Education.
Sexual harassment can take different forms depending on the  harasser and the nature of the harassment. The conduct can be carried out by  school employees, other students, and non-employee third parties, such as a  visiting speaker. Both male and female students can be victims of sexual  harassment, and the harasser and the victim can be of the same sex.
The conduct can occur in any school program or activity and  can take place in school facilities, on a school bus, or at other off-campus  locations, such as a school-sponsored field trip or a training program at  another location. The conduct can be verbal, nonverbal, or physical.
The judgment and common sense of teachers and school  administrators are very important elements in determining whether sexual  harassment has occurred and in determining an appropriate response, especially  when dealing with young children.
Example: A  school official sends a student a text message to arrange a time to meet for a  sexual encounter. Sending such a text message would constitute sexual conduct.
No. Legitimate nonsexual touching or conduct  generally will not be considered sexual harassment. However, it may rise to  that level if it takes on sexual connotations.
Example: A high school athletic coach hugs a  student who makes a goal. This by itself is not considered sexual conduct.  However, a coach’s hugging of a student could be considered sexual conduct if  it is unwelcome and occurs under inappropriate circumstances.
Sexual harassment includes conduct that is criminal in  nature, such as rape, sexual assault, dating violence, and sexually motivated  stalking. Even if a school reports possible criminal conduct to the police,  that does not relieve the school of its responsibilities under Title IX, which are discussed in Part Two.
Yes. Conduct is considered unwelcome if the student  did not request or invite it and considered the conduct to be undesirable or offensive.  The age of the student, the nature of the conduct, and other relevant factors  affect whether a student was capable of welcoming the sexual conduct. A  student’s submission to the conduct or failure to complain does not always mean  that the conduct was welcome.
Example 1: A middle school student makes  offensive sexual jokes to another student, but the student does not object to  the jokes or speak out against them. The student’s failure to object does not  mean that he or she has welcomed the comments.
Example  2: A female high school student willingly kisses a male student on one  occasion. When the student subsequently attempts to kiss her again, she  objects, but he kisses her anyway. This subsequent kiss is considered to be  unwelcome despite the welcomeness of the first kiss.
When does sexual conduct “deny or limit a student’s  ability to participate in or benefit from a school’s education program?”
Two general types of  sexual conduct can deny or limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit  from a school’s program. As discussed below, teachers and other school  employees can engage in either type of conduct, while students and third  parties can engage in only one type.
One form of sexual harassment occurs when a teacher or other  school employee conditions an educational decision or benefit on the student’s  submission to unwelcome sexual conduct. If this occurs, it does not matter  whether the student resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits to and  avoids the threatened harm.
Example:  A high school drama teacher tells a student that if she engages in sexual  activity with the teacher, she will be given the lead part in a school play.  The student agrees to participate in the sexual act but without desiring to do  so. The drama teacher thus has limited the student’s ability to benefit from  the school’s education program by conditioning the benefit of receiving the  lead role in the school play on the student’s submission to unwelcome sexual  conduct.
Sexual harassment also  occurs when a teacher, school employee, other student, or third party creates a  hostile environment that is sufficiently serious to deny or limit a student’s  ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program. Whether such a  hostile environment has been created depends on the particular circumstances of  the incident(s). Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to:
The conduct does not  necessarily have to be repetitive.  If  sufficiently severe, single or isolated incidents can create a hostile  environment.
Example  1: Throughout the school year, Student A repeatedly passes sexually explicit  photographs to Student B during class. The photographs are offensive to Student  B, and, consequently, Student B is unable to concentrate during class or focus  on the subject. Student A has created a hostile environment that limits Student  B’s ability to participate in the class.
Example 2: A high school student sexually  assaulted another high school student on one occasion when the two were alone  in a classroom. As a result, the victim is afraid of attending any classes or  coming into contact with the harasser. Although this was an isolated incident,  it is sufficiently severe to create a hostile environment.
School personnel should consider the age and maturity of  students in responding to allegations of sexual harassment. When determining  whether a young child has committed sexual harassment, it is important for  teachers and school administrators to use good judgment and common sense.
Example  1: On one occasion, a first-grade student kisses  another first-grade student on the cheek in the playground. This behavior does  not constitute sexual harassment.
Example 2: On numerous occasions over a period of several  months, a fifth-grade student inappropriately touches another fifth-grade  student and makes overtly sexual comments and gestures to that student. The  conduct is unwelcome and results in the victim’s grades falling because he or  she is unable to concentrate on studying. This behavior constitutes sexual  harassment.
Title IX prohibits harassing conduct that is of a  sexual nature if it is unwelcome and denies or limits a student's ability to  participate in or benefit from a school's program, regardless of whether the  harassment is aimed at gay or lesbian students or is perpetrated by individuals  of the same or opposite sex. Title IX does not address discrimination or  other issues related to sexual orientation.
Example  1: Throughout football season, a male member of the  high school football team makes unwelcome sexual advances toward another member  of the football team, who is a homosexual male. As a result, the victim quits  the football team. This conduct is sexual in nature, unwelcome, and has denied  the victim the ability to participate on the school football team. This is  sexual harassment covered by Title  IX.
Example 2: Students  heckle another student with comments that are based on the student’s sexual  orientation but are not sexual in nature (e.g., “gay students are not welcome  at this table in the lunch room”). Even if these comments are unwelcome and  deny the student’s ability to benefit from or participate in the school’s  education program, the conduct is not sexual, and this is not sexual harassment  covered by Title  IX.
If a student, his or her  parent, or a responsible employee reports the harassment, or a school employee  observes the harassment, the school should inform the harassed student (and the  student’s parent depending on the student’s age) of the options for formal and  informal action and of the school’s responsibilities, which are discussed  below. Regardless of whether the victim files a formal complaint or requests  action, the school must conduct a prompt, impartial, and thorough investigation  to determine what happened and must take appropriate steps to resolve the  situation.
If other sources, such as  a witness to the incident, an anonymous letter or phone call, or the media,  report the harassment, the school should respond in the same manner described  above if it is reasonable for the school to conduct an investigation and the  school can confirm the allegations. Considerations relevant to this  determination may include, but are not limited to, the:
The school should take  all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint in a manner  consistent with a request for confidentiality from a student. If a student  insists that his or her name not be disclosed to the harasser, the school’s  ability to respond may be limited. The school also must consider its  responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all  students. Thus, the school must weigh the confidentiality request against the  following factors:
Example:  A female elementary school student describes an incident to her teacher that  involved another teacher forcing her to engage in sexual activity. The student  begs the teacher to not tell anybody what happened. This is a situation in  which the school’s duty to provide all students with a safe environment might  outweigh the student’s request.
If the harasser is a teacher or another school employee and if the  harassment occurs while the school employee is acting, or reasonably appears to  be acting, in the context of his or her responsibilities to provide aid,  benefits, and services to students, the school is directly responsible for and  must remedy the harassment regardless of whether the school knew or should have  known that the incident occurred.
If the harasser is another student, a third party, or a school employee  who is not acting within the context of his or her responsibility to provide  aid, benefits, or services to students, then the school is responsible for  investigating the conduct and taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation  only when it knows or should have known that the harassment occurred.
Example: It is well-known to students and staff that graffiti  of a sexual nature appears on the sides of buildings throughout a school’s  campus in plain sight. The pervasiveness of this harassment may be enough to  conclude that the school should have known that the harassment occurred. If so,  then the school is responsible for investigating and responding to the  harassment regardless of whether it received a specific complaint about the  graffiti.
It may be necessary for  schools to take interim measures during the investigation of a complaint. For  instance, if a student alleges harassment by another student, the school may  keep those students separated until the investigation is complete. If a teacher  is the alleged harasser, it may be appropriate for the student to transfer to  another class.
It is a good practice for  schools to keep the student who alleged the harassment informed of the status  of the investigation.
The school must notify  the victim (and his or her parents depending on the age of the victim) of the  outcome of its investigation and of any punishments imposed that directly  relate to the victim, such as an order for the harasser to stay away from the  victim.
If the school determines  that a student was sexually harassed, the school must take reasonable, prompt,  age-appropriate, and effective action to end the harassment and prevent it from  happening again to the victim or to others. If the school fails to do so, it  must remedy the effects of the harassment on the victim that could have been  avoided if the school had responded promptly and effectively.
In addition, if the harasser is a school employee and if the  harassment occurs while the employee is acting, or reasonably appears to be  acting, in the context of carrying out his or her responsibilities to provide  aid, benefits, and services, the school must remedy the effects of the  harassment on the victim.
Example  1: A  teacher sexually harasses an eighth-grade student in the school hallway. The  student is not in any of the teacher’s classes and the teacher is not a hall  monitor. However, in light of the age and educational level of the student and  the status and degree of influence of teachers in secondary schools, the  student could reasonably believe that the teacher had at least informal  disciplinary authority over him or her. Therefore, this conduct is considered  to have occurred in the context of the teacher’s responsibility to provide aid,  benefits, and services to students, and thus the school must remedy the effects  of the harassment in addition to stopping it and preventing it from  recurring.
Example  2: A  faculty member of a university’s history department repeatedly, over several  weeks, touches and makes sexually suggestive remarks to a female graduate  engineering student while waiting for the university shuttle bus, riding on the  bus, and exiting the bus. As a result, the student stops using the bus and  walks the long distances between her classes.    This conduct occurred outside of  the context of the faculty member’s duties to provide aid, benefits, or  services to the student, and thus the school is not required to remedy the  effects of the harassment. However, if the school fails to take reasonable and  effective action to end the harassment after it has received notice of the  harassment, the school must remedy the effects of the harassment that could  have been avoided if the school had responded promptly and effectively.
The appropriate steps should be tailored to the specific  situation. For example, the school may need to develop and publicize new  policies or conduct training. Depending on the nature and severity of the  harassment, counseling, discipline, or further separation of the victim and  harasser may be necessary.
Responsive measures should be designed to minimize the  burden on the victim as much as possible. If the school’s initial response does  not stop the harassment and prevent it from happening again, the school may  need to take additional, stronger measures.
If the school is required to remedy the effects of the harassment on  the victim, the types of action required will vary depending on the  circumstances.
Example  1:   A college professor sexually harassed a student in his or her class in the  context of the professor’s duty to provide services to the student.  Consequently, the student was unable to concentrate during class and did not  learn the course material. To remedy the effects of the harassment, the school  may be required to take such actions as:
Example  2: A high school student informs the school  that another student in her class has been sexually harassing her and that, to  avoid him, she has been coming to class late. As a result, she has missed some  pop quizzes. If the school delays its response to this complaint and the victim  suffers additional effects of the harassment, such as missing additional pop  quizzes because she has to continue coming to class late, the school must  remedy the effects of the harassment that could have been prevented if the  school had responded promptly and effectively. In this case, the appropriate  remedy may include such actions as calculating the student’s grade without  factoring in the student’s failure to take the quizzes, giving the student  another opportunity to take the quizzes, or arranging for an independent  assessment of the student’s work.
Anybody who sees sexual harassment occur should report it;  the individual need not be the victim of the harassment. Schools should ensure  that employees clearly understand the extent of their responsibilities for  reporting sexual harassment.
The harassment should be  reported to a responsible school employee, such as a teacher, principal,  faculty member, administrator, security officer, affirmative action officer, or  professional staff member in the office of student affairs. Additionally, as  every school must have a Title IX coordinator, the harassment can be reported to this individual as well.
A student, parent, or other individual also may file a  complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights  (OCR), as explained below.
Title IX also protects students from retaliation. The school  must take steps to prevent the alleged harasser or anybody else at the school  from retaliating against the victim. Such steps include informing students that Title IX protects them from retaliation, making sure that victims know  how to report any future problems, and making follow-up inquiries to see if  there have been any new incidents. It also may be appropriate to counsel the  harasser to ensure that he or she understands that retaliation is prohibited.  If retaliation occurs, the school should take strong responsive actions.
Grievance procedures are internal school procedures that  address violations of a school’s policy against discrimination, including  sexual harassment.  Grievance procedures  must provide for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of sex  discrimination.
The school should make sure that its policy against sex  discrimination and grievance procedures are widely distributed and easily  understood by students, parents of elementary and secondary school students,  and employees. At a minimum, students must know that the grievance procedure  exists, know how it works, and know how to file a complaint. When a student or  parent reports sexual harassment, the school should explain how its grievance  procedures work and offer the student or parent the opportunity to use  them.
If a student or parent chooses to not use the school’s  grievance procedures, that does not relieve the school of its responsibilities  to investigate and take appropriate action, as explained above in Part Two.
The Title IX coordinator is responsible for  coordinating a school’s efforts to comply with and carry out its Title IX responsibilities. Every school must have a Title IX coordinator. Title  IX coordinators must have adequate training in sexual harassment and must  be able to explain the operation of the school’s grievance procedure.
Every school must notify all students and employees of the  name, office address, and telephone number of its Title IX coordinator(s).
OCR’s experience shows that the best way for a school to  deal with sexual harassment is to prevent it from occurring in the first place.  In addition to the requirements explained above (well-publicized  nondiscrimination policy, grievance procedures, and Title IX coordinator),  a school may take a number of other steps to prevent harassment.
For example, a school may conduct periodic sexual  harassment awareness training for all school staff, including administrators,  teachers, and guidance counselors, and age-appropriate sexual harassment  training for students. The training can include information on the types of  conduct that will be considered sexual harassment and the range of possible  consequences, the damage that results from harassment, where students can find  help, ways to oppose harassment, and what to do about it.
OCR is the federal agency  responsible for ensuring that schools comply with Title IX and other federal civil rights laws. One of OCR’s  responsibilities is to resolve complaints of discrimination, including sexual  harassment complaints. OCR has 12 enforcement offices located throughout the  country that carry out this responsibility.
An individual who wishes to file a complaint with OCR should  do so by contacting the enforcement office responsible for the state in which  that school is located. To find out which office is responsible for your state  and how to contact them, call 1-800-421-3481 or check OCR’s Web site at  http://www.ed.gov/ocr. Generally, the complaint  must be filed within 180 days of the date of the incident. Students and parents  are not required to use a school’s grievance procedures before filing a  compliant with OCR.

(c) Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association which would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and which receives Federal financial assistance.
The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.

(1) Each recipient shall implement specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational program or activity which it operates, and that it is required by title IX and this part not to discriminate in such a manner. Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the Assistant Secretary finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by title IX and this part, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in the education program or activity extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless Subpart C does not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of title IX and this part to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to §106.8, or to the Assistant Secretary.

(b) Publications. (1) Each recipient shall prominently include a statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form which it makes available to any person of a type, described in paragraph (a) of this section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment of students or employees.

(c) Distribution. Each recipient shall distribute without discrimination on the basis of sex each publication described in paragraph (b) of this section, and shall apprise each of its admission and employment recruitment representatives of the policy of nondiscrimination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and require such representatives to adhere to such policy.
Except as provided in this subpart, this part 106 applies to every recipient and to the education program or activity operated by such recipient which receives Federal financial assistance.
(a) Application. This part does not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization to the extent application of this part would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.

(b) Provision for transition plans. An educational institution to which this section applies shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in admission or recruitment in violation of subpart C unless it is carrying out a transition plan approved by the Secretary as described in §106.17, which plan provides for the elimination of such discrimination by the earliest practicable date but in no event later than June 23, 1979.

(3) Identify and describe with respect to the educational institution or administratively separate unit any obstacles to admitting students without discrimination on the basis of sex.
(4) Describe in detail the steps necessary to eliminate as soon as practicable each obstacle so identified and indicate the schedule for taking these steps and the individual directly responsible for their implementation.
(c) Nondiscrimination. No policy or practice of a recipient to which §106.16 applies shall result in treatment of applicants to or students of such recipient in violation of subpart C unless such treatment is necessitated by an obstacle identified in paragraph (b) (3) of this section and a schedule for eliminating that obstacle has been provided as required by paragraph (b) (4) of this section.
(d) Effects of past exclusion. To overcome the effects of past exclusion of students on the basis of sex, each educational institution to which §106.16 applies shall include in its transition plan, and shall implement, specific steps designed to encourage individuals of the previously excluded sex to apply for admission to such institution. Such steps shall include instituting recruitment which emphasizes the institution's commitment to enrolling students of the sex previously excluded.
(a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be denied admission, or be subjected to discrimination in admission, by any recipient to which this subpart applies, except as provided in §§106.16 and 106.17.
(b) Specific prohibitions. (1) In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall not:
(2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for admission which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria which do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.
(c) Prohibitions relating to marital or parental status. In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which this subpart applies:
(1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant which treats persons differently on the basis of sex;
(2) Shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice which so discriminates or excludes;
(3) Shall treat disabilities related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability or physical condition; and
(4) Shall not make pre-admission inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for admission, including whether such applicant is “Miss” or “Mrs.” A recipient may make pre-admission inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for admision, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this part.
A recipient to which this subpart applies shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this subpart.
(a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment. A recipient to which this subpart applies shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and admission of students. A recipient may be required to undertake additional recruitment efforts for one sex as remedial action pursuant to §106.3(a), and may choose to undertake such efforts as affirmative action pursuant to §106.3(b).
(b) Recruitment at certain institutions. A recipient to which this subpart applies shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at educational institutions, schools or entities which admit as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this subpart.
(a) General. Except as provided elsewhere in this part, no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance. This subpart does not apply to actions of a recipient in connection with admission of its students to an education program or activity of (1) a recipient to which subpart C does not apply, or (2) an entity, not a recipient, to which subpart C would not apply if the entity were a recipient.
(1) Treat one person differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service;
(6) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing significant assistance to any agency, organization, or person which discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit or service to students or employees;
(c) Assistance administered by a recipient educational institution to study at a foreign institution. A recipient educational institution may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other awards established by foreign or domestic wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments, or by acts of foreign governments and restricted to members of one sex, which are designed to provide opportunities to study abroad, and which are awarded to students who are already matriculating at or who are graduates of the recipient institution; Provided, a recipient educational institution which administers or assists in the administration of such scholarships, fellowships, or other awards which are restricted to members of one sex provides, or otherwise makes available reasonable opportunities for similar studies for members of the other sex. Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources.
(d) Aid, benefits or services not provided by recipient. (1) This paragraph applies to any recipient which requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or which facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments.
(i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure itself that the operator or sponsor of such other education program or activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee of such recipient which this part would prohibit such recipient from taking; and
(a) Generally. A recipient shall not, on the basis of sex, apply different rules or regulations, impose different fees or requirements, or offer different services or benefits related to housing, except as provided in this section (including housing provided only to married students).
(c) Other housing. (1) A recipient shall not, on the basis of sex, administer different policies or practices concerning occupancy by its students of housing other than provided by such recipient.
(2) A recipient which, through solicitation, listing, approval of housing, or otherwise, assists any agency, organization, or person in making housing available to any of its students, shall take such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure itself that such housing as is provided to students of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex, is as a whole:
A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.
(a) General standard. Except as provided for in this section or otherwise in this part, a recipient shall not provide or otherwise carry out any of its education programs or activities separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on the basis of sex.
(1) Contact sports in physical education classes. This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex within physical education classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(2) Ability grouping in physical education classes. This section does not prohibit grouping of students in physical education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard to sex.
(3) Human sexuality classes. Classes or portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools that deal primarily with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.
(b) Classes and extracurricular activities. (1) General standard. Subject to the requirements in this paragraph, a recipient that operates a nonvocational coeducational elementary or secondary school may provide nonvocational single-sex classes or extracurricular activities, if—
(A) To improve educational achievement of its students, through a recipient's overall established policy to provide diverse educational opportunities, provided that the single-sex nature of the class or extracurricular activity is substantially related to achieving that objective; or
(B) To meet the particular, identified educational needs of its students, provided that the single-sex nature of the class or extracurricular activity is substantially related to achieving that objective;
(iv) The recipient provides to all other students, including students of the excluded sex, a substantially equal coeducational class or extracurricular activity in the same subject or activity.
(2) Single-sex class or extracurricular activity for the excluded sex. A recipient that provides a single-sex class or extracurricular activity, in order to comply with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, may be required to provide a substantially equal single-sex class or extracurricular activity for students of the excluded sex.
(3) Substantially equal factors. Factors the Department will consider, either individually or in the aggregate as appropriate, in determining whether classes or extracurricular activities are substantially equal include, but are not limited to, the following: the policies and criteria of admission, the educational benefits provided, including the quality, range, and content of curriculum and other services and the quality and availability of books, instructional materials, and technology, the qualifications of faculty and staff, geographic accessibility, the quality, accessibility, and availability of facilities and resources provided to the class, and intangible features, such as reputation of faculty.
(4) Periodic evaluations. (i) The recipient must conduct periodic evaluations to ensure that single-sex classes or extracurricular activities are based upon genuine justifications and do not rely on overly broad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of either sex and that any single-sex classes or extracurricular activities are substantially related to the achievement of the important objective for the classes or extracurricular activities.
(5) Scope of coverage. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) through (4) of this section apply to classes and extracurricular activities provided by a recipient directly or through another entity, but the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) through (4) of this section do not apply to interscholastic, club, or intramural athletics, which are subject to the provisions of §§106.41 and 106.37(c) of this part.
(c) Schools. (1) General Standard. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a recipient that operates a public nonvocational elementary or secondary school that excludes from admission any students, on the basis of sex, must provide students of the excluded sex a substantially equal single-sex school or coeducational school.
(2) Exception. A nonvocational public charter school that is a single-school local educational agency under State law may be operated as a single-sex charter school without regard to the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3) Substantially equal factors. Factors the Department will consider, either individually or in the aggregate as appropriate, in determining whether schools are substantially equal include, but are not limited to, the following: The policies and criteria of admission, the educational benefits provided, including the quality, range, and content of curriculum and other services and the quality and availability of books, instructional materials, and technology, the quality and range of extracurricular offerings, the qualifications of faculty and staff, geographic accessibility, the quality, accessibility, and availability of facilities and resources, and intangible features, such as reputation of faculty.
(4) Definition. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(1) through (3) of this section, the term “school” includes a “school within a school,” which means an administratively separate school located within another school.
(b) Use of appraisal and counseling materials. A recipient which uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or use materials which permit or require different treatment of students on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.
(c) Disproportion in classes. Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.
(1) On the basis of sex, provide different amount or types of such assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance which is of any particular type or source, apply different criteria, or otherwise discriminate;
(2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person which provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner which discriminates on the basis of sex; or
(3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance which treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.
(b) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government which requires that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein; Provided, That the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
(i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
(ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
(iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.
(c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.
(2) Separate athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid for members of each sex may be provided as part of separate athletic teams for members of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph and §106.41.
(Authority: Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 U.S.C. 1681, 1682; and Sec. 844, Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93–380, 88 Stat. 484)
(a) Assistance by recipient in making available outside employment. A recipient which assists any agency, organization or person in making employment available to any of its students:
In providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner which would violate Subpart E of this part if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service which may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any recipient which provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.
(a) Status generally. A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
(b) Pregnancy and related conditions. (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.
(2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation so long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
(3) A recipient which operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
(4) A recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan or policy which such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
(5) In the case of a recipient which does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status which she held when the leave began.
(a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.
(b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of this part, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(c) Equal opportunity. A recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the Director will consider, among other factors:
Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the Assistant Secretary may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.
(d) Adjustment period. A recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from the effective date of this regulation. A recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics at the secondary or post-secondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from the effective date of this regulation.
(Authority: Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 U.S.C. 1681, 1682; and Sec. 844, Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93–380, 88 Stat. 484)
If use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in physical education classes has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have that effect.
(a) General. (1) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance.
(2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way which could adversely affect any applicant's or employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.
(3) A recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting employees or students to discrimination prohibited by this subpart, including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, and with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient.
(4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this part.
(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, consideration for and award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, application of nepotism policies, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;
(6) Granting and return from leaves of absence, leave for pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, leave for persons of either sex to care for children or dependents, or any other leave;
(8) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, selection for tuition assistance, selection for sabbaticals and leaves of absence to pursue training;
A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for any employment opportunity which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless:
(a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring. A recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or hiring of employees, or has been found to have in the past so discriminated, the recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
(b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at entities which furnish as applicants only or predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this subpart.
(b) Results in the payment of wages to employees of one sex at a rate less than that paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.
(c) Maintain or establish separate lines of progression, seniority systems, career ladders, or tenure systems for similar jobs, position descriptions, or job requirements which classify persons on the basis of sex, unless sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for the positions in question as set forth in §106.61.
(a) Fringe benefits defined. For purposes of this part, fringe benefits means: Any medical, hospital, accident, life insurance or retirement benefit, service, policy or plan, any profit-sharing or bonus plan, leave, and any other benefit or service of employment not subject to the provision of §106.54.
(1) Discriminate on the basis of sex with regard to making fringe benefits available to employees or make fringe benefits available to spouses, families, or dependents of employees differently upon the basis of the employee's sex;
(2) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a fringe benefit plan which does not provide either for equal periodic benefits for members of each sex, or for equal contributions to the plan by such recipient for members of each sex; or
(3) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a pension or retirement plan which establishes different optional or compulsory retirement ages based on sex or which otherwise discriminates in benefits on the basis of sex.
(2) Which is based upon whether an employee or applicant for employment is the head of household or principal wage earner in such employee's or applicant's family unit.
(b) Pregnancy. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude from employment any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom.
(c) Pregnancy as a temporary disability. A recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom and any temporary disability resulting therefrom as any other temporary disability for all job related purposes, including commencement, duration and extensions of leave, payment of disability income, accrual of seniority and any other benefit or service, and reinstatement, and under any fringe benefit offered to employees by virtue of employment.
(d) Pregnancy leave. In the case of a recipient which does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status which she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
(a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with this subpart is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement which imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex which are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
(b) Benefits. A recipient which provides any compensation, service, or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or benefit to members of the other sex.
A recipient shall not in any advertising related to employment indicate preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on sex unless sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for the particular job in question.
(a) Marital status. A recipient shall not make pre-employment inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for employment, including whether such applicant is “Miss or Mrs.”
(b) Sex. A recipient may make pre-employment inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for employment, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this part.
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by this subpart provided it is shown that sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section which is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

Guidelines regarding Single Sex Classes and Schools
Office for Civil Rights; Single-Sex Classes and Schools: Guidelines on Title IX Requirements
ACTION: Guidelines on current title IX requirements related to single-sex classes and schools.
On January 8, 2002, the President signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act
of 2001, which reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965. Section
5131(a)(23) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act allows local educational
agencies (LEAs) to use Innovative Programs funds to support same-gender schools
and classrooms consistent with applicable law. It also requires the Department,
within 120 days of enactment, to issue guidelines for LEAs regarding the applicable
law on single-sex classes and schools. This notice fully implements Congress's
mandate by describing and explaining the current statutory and regulatory requirements

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice implements Congress's mandate in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB Act) to provide guidelines to LEAs regarding the applicable law on single-sex classes and schools.See
Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register is a notice of intent to
regulate (NOIR), which invites comment on our intention to amend the current
regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title
IX) related to elementary and secondary single-sex classes and schools to provide
more flexibility to educators. The purpose of these amendments would be to support
efforts of school districts to improve educational outcomes for children and
to provide public school parents with a diverse array of educational options
that respond to the educational needs of their children, while at the same time
ensuring appropriate safeguards against discrimination. The NOIR is intended
to begin this process and ensure adequate public input on these important and
classes: The Title IX statute generally prohibits sex-based discrimination
in education programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.
Specifically, it states that no person in the United States, on the basis of
sex, can be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
1681(a) of Title IX contains two limited exceptions relating to classes or activities
within primary and secondary schools that otherwise are coeducational. Subsection
1681(a)(7)(B) of Title IX exempts any program or activity of any secondary school
or educational institution specifically intended for the promotion of any Boys
State conference, Boys Nation conference, Girls State conference, or Girls Nation
conference or for the selection of students to attend such a conference. Subsection
1681(a)(8) of Title IX states that the law does not preclude father‑son
or mother‑daughter activities at an educational institution. However,
if those activities are provided for students of one sex, opportunities for
reasonably comparable activities must be provided for students of the other
sex. Accordingly, these activities are permitted on a single-sex basis if the
Title IX regulations generally prohibit single-sex classes or activities.The
A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on such basis, including health, physical education,    industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses.
contain two categorical exceptions for specific types of classes or portions
of classes that may be segregated by sex. Those exceptions are: (1) physical
education classes during participation in sports the purpose or major activity
of which involves bodily contact (34 CFR 106.34(c)); and (2) portions of classes
in elementary and secondary schools which deal exclusively with human sexuality.
(34 CFR 106.34(e)). In addition separation of students by sex is permitted if
it constitutes remedial or affirmative action. 34 CFR 106.3[2]
exempts from its coverage the admissions practices of non-vocational elementary
the regulations do not prohibit recipients from adopting single-sex admissions
policies in non-vocational elementary and secondary schools.See 34 CFR
106.15(d). However, the regulations specifically provide that an LEA may exclude
any person from admission to a non-vocational elementary or secondary school
on the basis of sex only if such recipient otherwise makes available to such
person, pursuant to the same policies and criteria of admission, courses, services,
and facilities comparable to each course, service, and facility offered in or
In other words, under the current regulations, an LEA cannot use a single-sex
admissions policy -- which is not itself subject to Title IX's prohibition --
as the predicate for otherwise causing students, on the basis of sex, to be
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance. For example, school districts may not establish a single-sex school
for one sex that provides the district's only performing arts curriculum. Students
of the other sex also must have access to a comparable school with that curriculum.
It has been our longstanding interpretation, policy, and practice to require
that the comparable school must also be single-sex.
offer a single single-sex school if such an action constitutes remedial or affirmative
while the statutory exemption precludes the Department from examining an LEA's
justification for a single-sex school, LEAs also should be aware of constitutional
LEAs may be challenged in court litigation on constitutional grounds.

statute also exempts activities of educational institutions controlled by
religious organizations to the extent that the application of Title IX would
be inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization. 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(3).
current regulations also permit recipients to group students in physical education
classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective standards of individual
performance developed and applied without regard to sex (34 CFR 106.34(b))
and to make requirements based on vocal range or quality which may result
in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex. (34 CFR 106.34(f))
of Title IX states that in regard to admissions to educational institutions,
the law applies only to institutions of vocational education, professional
education, and graduate higher education, and to public institutions of undergraduate
higher education. As such, non-vocational elementary and secondary schools
provisions on single-sex schools do not apply to private elementary and secondary

I am writing to inform you that the U.S. Department of  Education (Department) has amended the regulations implementing Title IX of the  Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. (Title IX),  applicable to nonvocational single-sex classes, extracurricular activities, and  schools at the elementary and secondary education levels.  These new regulations were published in the Federal Register on October 25, 2006, and took effect on November 24, 2006.
The new regulations apply to local educational agencies  (LEAs) and other recipients of financial assistance from the Department that  provide nonvocational elementary and secondary education.  They provide recipients more flexibility to  offer nonvocational elementary and secondary classes, extracurricular  activities, and schools on a single-sex basis, consistent with the  nondiscrimination requirements of Title IX.   Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education  programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance.
The purpose of these new regulations is to provide  requirements that, if implemented by recipients, will ensure compliance with  Title IX in those situations in which recipients choose to provide  nonvocational single-sex education.   Like the former regulations, the new regulations do not require that  recipients provide single-sex education.   Single-sex education is merely an option.  Recipients of financial assistance from the Department that  choose to provide single-sex education should carefully evaluate their policies  and practices and ensure their programs meet the requirements of the  regulations.
The new regulations provide for a new exception to the  general prohibition against single-sex classes and extracurricular  activities.  Under the former  regulations, single-sex classes were generally prohibited in a coeducational  school with specific limited exceptions, such as for sex education classes and  contact sports in physical education classes.   The new regulations retain the specific exceptions from the former  regulations and add a new exception, which permits a recipient to provide  single-sex nonvocational classes and extracurricular activities based on the  recipient’s “important objective.”  Each  single-sex class or extracurricular activity must be based on the recipient’s  important objective.
The new regulations establish two important objectives  upon which a recipient may base a single-sex class or extracurricular  activity.  The first important objective  is to improve educational achievement of its students through a recipient’s  overall established policy to provide diverse educational opportunities.  The second important objective is to meet  the particular, identified educational needs of a recipient’s students.  Regardless of the recipient’s important  objective, the regulations require that the single-sex nature of the class or  extracurricular activity be substantially related to achieving the recipient’s  important objective.
A recipient that chooses to provide  single-sex classes or extracurricular activities is required to implement its  important objective in an evenhanded manner with respect to male and female  students.  The regulations require that  student enrollment in any single-sex class or extracurricular activity must be  completely voluntary.  The regulations  also require that the recipient provide to all students, including the students  excluded from the single-sex class or extracurricular activity based on sex, a  substantially equal coeducational class or extracurricular activity in the same  subject or activity.  In addition to the  required substantially equal coeducational class or extracurricular activity, a  recipient, if necessary to comply with the requirement to implement its  objective in an evenhanded manner, may also be required to provide a  substantially equal single-sex class or extracurricular activity in the same  subject or activity to students of the excluded sex.
After a recipient has established single-sex classes or  extracurricular activities under this new regulatory exception, the regulations  require recipients to conduct periodic self-evaluations of their single-sex  classes or extracurricular activities at least every two years.  Recipients are required to ensure through  their self-evaluation that there is a substantial relationship between the  single-sex nature of the class or activity and achievement of the important  objective.  Recipients also are required  to ensure that their single-sex classes or extracurricular activities are based  on genuine justifications and do not rely on overly broad generalizations about  the different talents, capacities, or preferences of either sex.
With respect to requirements for offering single-sex  public schools, the new regulations also provide more flexibility.  The former regulations permitted an LEA to  offer a nonvocational single-sex school if it offered a corresponding school  for students of the other sex.  Under  the Department’s interpretation of the former requirements, the corresponding  school must also have been a single-sex school.  Under the new regulations, an LEA is permitted to offer a  single-sex school to students of one sex if it provides a substantially equal  school to students excluded from the single-sex school based on sex, but that  school may be either single-sex or coeducational.  The new regulations also allow a nonvocational public charter  school that is a single-school LEA under State law an exemption from the  requirement to provide a substantially equal school for students of the  excluded sex.
Enclosed for your convenience is a copy of the new  regulatory provisions.  When the final  regulations were published in the Federal Register, the  regulatory provisions were accompanied by additional explanatory  information.  An electronic link to the Federal Register and this supplementary information is available on the  Department’s Web site at http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.pdf.
The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the Department enforces  the Title IX regulations, among other civil rights requirements, and provides  technical assistance to school districts and other recipients that request such  assistance in voluntarily complying with the civil rights laws enforced by  OCR.  To submit questions and requests  for technical assistance in connection with these new requirements, you may  address them to T9singlesexTA@ed.gov,  a dedicated e-mail address, which will be in operation until December 31, 2007.
I look forward to continuing our work together to ensure  equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the  nation.  Thank you for your efforts on  behalf of America’s students.
Our mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.

Skip to main contentAbout UsContact UsFAQs Language Assistance Englishespañol中文: 繁體版Việt-ngữ한국어TagalogРусский
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  (Title IX) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in all education  programs and activities operated by recipients of federal funds, including  colleges, universities, and public school districts. Unless they are  specifically exempt, Title IX applies to all institutions that receive federal  financial assistance from the Department of Education, including state and  local educational agencies. Recipients subject to Title IX include  approximately 16,500 local school districts, 7,000 postsecondary institutions,  as well as charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums. Also  included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of 50  states, the District of Columbia, and territories and possessions of the United  States. OCR enforces Title IX to ensure that students have equal access to  educational opportunity and can go to school without fear of sex  discrimination.

The United States Department  of Justice on Title IX
Since the attached Title IX Legal Manual was issued in 2001, sex discrimination jurisprudence has developed significantly.  Notably, on June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County that sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (Title VII) encompasses discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status.  140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741, 590 U.S. ___, ___ (2020).
Though Title VII and Title IX are two distinct statutes, their statutory prohibitions against sex discrimination are similar, such that Title VII jurisprudence is frequently used as a guide to inform Title IX.  See Manual, Chapters I, IV.  Indeed, in the months following the Bostock decision, several federal courts have reached the same conclusion as to Title IX, holding that Title IX protects transgender students from discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  See, e.g., Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 616-17 (4th Cir. 2020) (“Although Bostock interprets [Title VII], it guides our evaluation of claims under Title IX.”), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020), reh’g en banc denied, 976 F. 3d 399 (4th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, No. 20-1163 (June 28, 2021); B.P.J. v. W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ., No. 2:21-CV-00316, 2021 WL 3081883, at *7 (S.D.W. Va. July 21, 2021); Koenke v. Saint Joseph's Univ., No. CV 19-4731, 2021 WL 75778, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 8, 2021); Doe v. Univ. of Scranton, No. 3:19-CV-01486, 2020 WL 5993766, at *11 n.61 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 9, 2020).  Other circuits reached this conclusion before Bostock, relying on their own Title VII jurisprudence.  See Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1049-50 (7th Cir. 2017) (transgender boy was likely to succeed on his claim that school district violated Title IX by excluding him from the boys’ restroom); Dodds v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 845 F.3d 217, 221-22 (6th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (school district that sought to exclude transgender girl from girls’ restroom was not likely to succeed on the claim because Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender nonconformity).
On March 26, 2021, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division issued a memorandum to federal civil rights offices and general counsels addressing the application of Bostock to Title IX, determining that Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.  See Letter from Pamela S. Karlan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, to Federal Civil Rights Directors and General Counsels (Mar. 26, 2021), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-202106-tix.pdf.
The reasoning in these interpretations applies with equal force to discrimination against intersex people.  “Intersex” refers to people born with variations in physical sex characteristics—including genitals, gonads, chromosomes, and hormonal factors—that do not fit typical definitions of male or female bodies.  The Bostock Court addressed discrimination against “persons with one sex identified at birth and another today.”  140 S. Ct. at 1747.  Discrimination against intersex individuals is similarly motivated by perceived differences between an individual’s specific sex characteristics and their sex category (either as identified at birth or some subsequent time).  Additionally, discrimination based on anatomical or physiological sex characteristics (such as genitals, gonads, chromosomes, and hormone function) is inherently sex-based.  Intersex traits, like gender identity and sexual orientation, are “inextricably bound up with” sex.  See id. at 1742.  In other words, it is impossible to discuss intersex status without also referring to sex.  Cf. Grimm, 972 F.3d at 609.  Lastly, discrimination based on intersex traits may also involve sex stereotypes, as intersex people by definition have traits that do not conform to stereotypes about male or female bodies.  Cf. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1048 (“[A] transgender individual does not conform to the sex-based stereotypes of the sex that [they were] assigned at birth.”)
While this Manual is not intended to provide a complete, comprehensive directory of all cases or issues related to Title IX, these important developments are highlighted here to clarify the Department’s position that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity, intersex traits, and sexual orientation.
This Manual provides an overview of the legal principles of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. ï½§1681 et seq. It is intended to be an abstract of general principles and issues for use by various federal agencies charged with enforcing Title IX and is not intended to provide a complete, comprehensive directory of all cases or issues related to Title IX. In addition, this document is not intended to be a guide for Title IX enforcement with respect to traditional educational institutions such as colleges, universities, and elementary and secondary schools, which have been subject to the Department of Educations Title IX regulations and guidance for 25 years. Rather, this Manual is intended to provide guidance to federal agencies concerning the wide variety of other education programs and activities operated by recipients of federal financial assistance. Such programs, many of which first became subject to Title IX regulations when the Title IX final common rule became effective on September 29, 2000, may include police academies, job training programs, vocational training for prison inmates, and other education programs operated by recipients of federal assistance.
For more specific information on Title IX as it relates to educational institutions, readers should consult the various documents written and published by the Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights that can be found on the Department of Education website. Documents which may be consulted include: Proposed Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 65 Fed. Reg. 66092 (2000) (the final Sexual Harassment Guidance is anticipated for a January 2001 publication); Policy Interpretation-Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics, 45 C.F.R. Part 26 (1979); Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part Test, dated January 16, 1996; Guidance on the Awarding of Athletic Financial Assistance (OCR letter to Bowling Green, July 23, 1998), as well as various other pamphlets, memoranda, and documents. This Manual is in no way intended to supersede any guidance issued by the Department of Education, and, to the extent that this Manual is construed to conflict with guidance issued by the Department of Education regarding traditional educational institutions, the Department of Educations Guidance should be followed.
Moreover, since this Manual is not designed to address Title IX enforcement with respect to traditional educational institutions, a number of subjects that pertain primarily to schools, such as athletics, are not addressed in depth. However, the vast majority of Title IX cases do involve educational institutions and so, of course, the Manual cites extensively to those cases in identifying applicable legal principles. Although this Manual generally cites to cases interpreting Title IX, cases interpreting Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 are also included. While statutory interpretation of these laws overlap, they are not fully consistent, and this document should not be considered to be an overview of any statute other than Title IX. Although this Manual is intended primarily for federal agency investigators use, it includes discussion of many cases involving individual Title IX lawsuits. It is important for federal agencies to remember that the standard for a Federal agency to determine whether a recipient has violated Title IX differs from the higher liability standard of proof that must be met in a court action before compensatory damages are awarded. Recipients have an affirmative duty to correct Title IX violations even if no monetary damages would be awarded because of the violation.
This Manual is intended only to provide guidance on general principles related to Title IX enforcement outside the context of traditional educational institutions. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party against the United States.
In June 1972, President Nixon signed Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 into law. Title IX is a comprehensive federal law that has removed many barriers that once prevented people, on the basis of sex, from participating in educational opportunities and careers of their choice. It states that:
20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1681, et seq. Title IX applies to all aspects of education programs or activities operated by recipients of federal financial assistance.1 In addition to educational institutions such as colleges, universities, and elementary and secondary schools, Title IX also applies to any education or training program operated by a recipient of federal financial assistance. For example, Title IX would cover such diverse activities as a forestry workshop run by a state park receiving funds from the Department of Interior; a boater education program sponsored by a county parks and recreation department receiving funding from the Coast Guard; a local course concerning how to start a small business, sponsored by the state department of labor that receives funding from the Small Business Administration; state and local courses funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in planning how to deal with disasters; and vocational training for inmates in prisons receiving assistance from the Department of Justice (hereinafter referred to as "DOJ" or "Justice Department" or "the Department"). Generally, it covers all aspects of the education program, including admissions, treatment of participants, and employment. Title IX guarantees equal educational opportunity in federally funded programs.
Congress consciously modeled Title IX on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal funds. Note that Title VIs protections are not limited to "education" programs and activities, as are those of Title IX.
The two statutes both condition an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate, in what is essentially a contract between the government and the recipient of funds. Because of this close connection between the statutes, Title VI legal precedent provides some important guidance for the application of Title IX. See, e.g., Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 694-98 (1979)(Congress intended that Title IX would be interpreted and applied as Title VI has been). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federally funded programs, was also modeled after Title VI and, hence, may also provide guidance for an analysis of Title IX. See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 294 (1985)(Because Title IX, Section 504, and Title VI contain parallel language, the same analytic framework should generally apply in cases under all three statutes). These statutes were enacted to prevent unlawful discrimination and to provide remedies for the effects of past discrimination.
Although much of Title VI case law can be applied to Title IX situations, the analogy is not perfect because Title IX contains several important exemptions that are absent in Title VI. For example, with regard to single-sex admissions policies, Title IXs prohibitions against sex discrimination apply only to vocational, professional, graduate, and public undergraduate schools (except for those public institutions of undergraduate higher education that traditionally and continually from their establishment have had a policy of admitting only students of one sex).2 Title IX does not cover the single-sex admissions policies of elementary, secondary, (other than vocational schools), or private undergraduate schools.
Additional Title IX exemptions include the membership policies of certain university-based social fraternities and sororities, the Girl and Boy Scouts, the YMCA and YWCA, the Camp Fire Girls and certain other voluntary single-sex and tax-exempt youth service organizations whose members are chiefly under age 19.
Also exempt are any programs or activities of the American Legion undertaken in connection with the organization or operation of any Boys State conference, Boys Nation conference, Girls State conference, or Girls Nation conference; and any program or activity of a secondary school or educational institution specifically for the promotion of any Boys State conference, Boys Nation conference or the selection of students to attend any such conference. Further, Title IX does not apply to father-son or mother-daughter activities at an educational institution - but if such activities are provided for students of one sex, reasonably comparable opportunities much be provided for members of the other sex. Finally, any scholarship or other financial assistance awarded by an institution of higher education to an individual because such individual has received such award in a single-sex pageant is exempt provided the pageant complies with other nondiscrimination provisions of federal law.
Title IX exempts from coverage any educational operation of an entity that is controlled by a religious organization only to the extent Title IX would be inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization.3 For example, Title IX would not require a religiously controlled organization that trains students for the ministry to offer such training to women if the organizations religious tenets hold that all ministers must be men. Title IX also exempts institutions that train individuals for the military or the merchant marine.
In addition to the statutory exemptions discussed above, the Title IX common rule contains a few other exceptions permitting single-sex programs under certain limited circumstances. For example, section ___.110(a)requires appropriate remedial action if a designated agency official finds that a recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of sex. In the absence of a finding of discrimination, section ___.110(b) permits affirmative action consistent with law to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in a program by persons of a particular sex. Either of these provisions could permit single-sex programs under appropriate circumstances. In addition, several other regulatory provisions permit single-sex programs: section ___.415(b)(5) permits portions of education programs or activities that deal exclusively with human sexuality to be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls; section ___.445(b) permits a program offered to pregnant students on a voluntary basis that is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students; sections ___.414(b)(2) and (6) permit recipients to make requirements based on objective standards of physical ability or of vocal range or quality; and section __ .415(b)(3) permits separation by sex in physical education classes involving contact sports. In addition, section 420(b) permits exclusion, on the basis of sex, of any person from admission to a nonvocational school operated by a local education agency, so long as "...such recipient otherwise makes available to such person, pursuant to the same policies and criteria of admission, courses, services, and facilities comparable to each course, service, and facility offered in or through such schools." 4
It is important to note that even though Title IX carves out the above exceptions to its general prohibition on sex discrimination, governmental/public recipients may still have a constitutional duty not to discriminate on the basis of sex. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a governmental classification based on sex can be lawful only if the classification serves "important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed" are "substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724(1982)(nursing school could not justify excluding male applicants; policy violated the Fourteenth Amendment notwithstanding Title IX exemption, quoting, Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)). For example, even though Title IX may not prohibit a traditionally single-sex public entity providing training for nurses from excluding male applicants, the public entity must still demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for the restrictive admission policy in order to survive an equal protection challenge. Id. at 724 (citing, Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981)). See also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996)(U.S. Department of Justice successfully challenged military schools male-only admissions policy under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act.
The Title IX regulations contain a variety of procedural requirements, the most important of which is the requirement to establish grievance procedures. The regulations require that every recipient to which Title IX applies "adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints alleging any action that be prohibited by these Title IX regulations." ï½§ ___.135. These grievance procedures are an essential element in ensuring that Title IX and its implementing regulations are complied with in the least contentious manner possible.5
Unlike Title VI which covers employment only in limited circumstances, Title IX clearly covers employment discrimination. Title IXs availability as an independent basis to attack discriminatory employment practices does not mean, however, that its analytical and evaluative methodology is divorced from that used under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rather, like Title VI, Title IX borrows heavily from Title VII in its theory and approach to sex-based employment discrimination. It is generally accepted outside the sexual harassment context that the substantive standards and policies developed under Title VII apply with equal force to employment actions brought under Title IX. By contrast, however, it is generally held that Title IX does not incorporate the procedural requirements of Title VII. For a more detailed discussion of the relationship between Title IX and Title VII, see Chapter IV(b) of this Manual. Section 5 of that chapter discusses the joint rule issued by the Department of Justice and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sets forth procedures that federal agencies are to utilize when processing Title IX employment cases.
Congress enacted Title IX with two principal objectives in mind: to avoid the use of federal resources to support discriminatory practices in education programs, and to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979).
As the womens civil rights movement gained momentum in the late 1960's and early 1970's, sex bias and discrimination in schools emerged as a major public policy concern. Women, who were entering the workforce in record numbers, faced a persistent earnings gap compared to their male counterparts. As a consequence of the equality in the workforce debate, Americans also began to focus attention generally on inequities that inhibited the progress of women and girls in education. Several advocacy groups filed class action lawsuits against colleges and universities and the federal government. These advocacy organizations complained of an industry-wide pattern of sex bias against women who worked in colleges and universities. As a consequence, Congress focused on the issue of sex bias in education during the summer of 1970 at a set of hearings on discrimination against women before a special House Subcommittee on Education chaired by Representative Edith Green (Oregon). Representative Green introduced a higher education bill with provisions regarding sex equity wherein she unsuccessfully attempted to add a prohibition on sex discrimination to the Education Amendments of 1971.
A year later, Title IX began its congressional life in earnest when an amendment was introduced in the Senate by Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, who explained that its purpose was to combat "the continuation of corrosive and unjustified discrimination against women in the American educational system." 118 Cong. Rec. 5803 (1972). During debate, Senator Bayh stressed the fact that economic inequities suffered by women can often be traced to educational inequities. In support of the amendment, Senator Bayh pointed to the link between discrimination in education and subsequent employment opportunities:
The field of education is just one of many areas where differential treatment [between men and women] has been documented but because education provides access to jobs and financial security, discrimination here is doubly destructive for women. Therefore, a strong and comprehensive measure is needed to provide women with solid legal protection from the persistent, pernicious discrimination which is serving to perpetuate second-class citizenship for American women.
Congressional activity on the issue increased with the introduction of various proposals in the House and Senate to end sex discrimination in education. Although there was growing consensus that sex discrimination in education should end, there was little agreement as to the best methods for reaching that goal. Some critics claimed that the legislation was intended to try to maintain a certain quota or ratio of male to female students. Senator Bayh reiterated many times during the debate that "the amendment is not designed to require specific quotas. The thrust of the amendment is to do away with every quota." 117 Cong. Rec. 30,409 (1971). The Senator went on to state that, "The language of my amendment does not require reverse discrimination. It only requires that each individual be judged on merit, without regard to sex." Id.
Even with Senator Bayhs repeated assurances against quotas, it took a House-Senate Conference Committee several months to iron out the differences between the House and Senate education bills. In the end, the House attached a floor amendment to the bill specifying that the legislation would not require quotas.6 The newly clarified legislation was enacted as Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C.A. ï½§ 1681, et seq., on June 23, 1972.
Despite this lengthy process, Title IX was passed without much debate as to several of its key exemption provisions. For example, early on it was unclear whether Congress intended to regulate intercollegiate athletics. For this reason, the statute was amended in 1974 to direct the Department of Health Education and Welfare to publish proposed implementing regulations, with a provision stating that such regulations shall include with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities, reasonable provisions considering the nature of the particular sports.7
In 1988 Congress enacted the CRRA to restore the broad interpretation accorded the phrase "program or activity" prior to the Supreme Courts decision in Grove City College V. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984)8. The CRRA amends Title IX and other related nondiscrimination statutes to afford broad coverage to all of the operations of a recipient (although Title IXs prohibition against sex discrimination applies only in a recipients "education" programs). The CRRA clarifies the definition of "program or activity" or "program." The scope of coverage is no longer limited to the exact purpose or nature of the federal funding. For example, if a State prison receives federal financial assistance, all the operations of the State Department of Corrections are covered by Title VI and Section 504, and all the departments education and training programs are covered by Title IX. Moreover, it is well established that, when a recipient is an educational institution, all of the institutions operations are covered by Title IXs antidiscrimination provisions. See Chapter III(C) for a more detailed discussion of these concepts.
Moreover, it also should be noted that, consistent with the CRRAs purpose of achieving broad, institution-wide coverage of a federal funding recipients program or activity, there is no requirement that federal funds be extended directly to an "educational" portion of a recipients program in order to trigger coverage under Title IX. Rather, any federal financial assistance subjects a recipients entire program or activity to coverage under all four civil rights statutes, but Title IXs prohibition on sex-based discrimination applies only to the educational components of a recipients program. For example, in the hypothetical described above, federal funds distributed to a Department of Corrections for a non-educational operation such as the provision of medical services would subject all of the Departments educational operations to coverage under Title IX.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or services, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or individual because such person or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion. 20 U.S.C. ï½§1688.
Consistent with the Danforth Amendment, the Title IX common rule does not require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion. However, medical procedures, benefits, services, and the use of facilities, necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman or to address complications related to an abortion are not subject to this section. 65 Fed. Reg. 52869 (2000)(Section __.235(d)(1)). Moreover, the Title IX common rule prohibits a recipient from discriminating against, excluding, or denying benefits to a person because that person has obtained, sought, or will seek an abortion. This prohibition applies to any service or benefit for an applicant (for enrollment or employment), student, or employee. 65 Fed. Reg. 52869 (2000)(Section __.235(d)(2)).
In addition, the CRRA expanded the exemption for entities controlled by religious organizations. Under the CRRA, the exemption is no longer limited to educational institutions that are controlled by religious organizations with tenets contrary to Title IX. Instead, any educational operation of an entity may be exempt from Title IX due to control by a religious organization with tenets that are not consistent with the provisions of Title IX. Further, the exemption would apply to a particular education program operated by a recipient if this separate program is subject to religious tenets that are not consistent with Title IX.
An educational institution or other entity that wishes to claim the exemption set forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall do so by submitting in writing to the designated agency official a statement by the highest-ranking official of the institution, identifying the provisions of these Title IX regulations that conflict with a specific tenet of the religious organization.
Section ___.205(b). The preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of the Title IX common rule explains that if a recipient has already obtained an exemption from the Department of Education, such exemption may be submitted to another funding agency as a basis for an exemption from the second funding agency. 64 Fed. Reg. 58570 (1999).
Title IX requires that agencies promulgate regulations to provide guidance to recipients of federal financial assistance who administer education programs or activities on Title IX enforcement. After the passage of Title IX, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) adopted implementing regulations. 40 Fed. Reg. 24128 (1975). When HEW split in 1980 into two departments, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services, each new agency adopted the regulations. See 34 C.F.R. Part 106 and 45 C.F.R. Part 86, respectively. Two other federal agencies, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy, also published Title IX rules around that same time.9
On October 29, 1999 the Department of Justice and 23 other agencies published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to implement Title IX. See 64 Fed. Reg. 58567 (1999). In the Title IX common rule, the substantive nondiscrimination obligations of recipients, for the most part, are identical to those established by the Department of Education under Title IX. However, the rule reflects statutory changes to Title IX, such as those resulting from passage of the CRRA, and modifications to ensure consistency with Supreme Court precedent. After receiving and reviewing comments, and making a few additional changes to the regulations in response to these comments, the Department of Justice and 20 other participating agencies published the final Title IX common rule on August 30, 2000.10 See 65 Fed. Reg. 52857 (2000).
Title IX prohibits, with certain exceptions, any entity that receives "federal financial assistance" from discriminating against individuals on the basis of sex in education programs or activities.11 The clearest example of federal financial assistance is the award or grant of money. However, federal financial assistance may also be in nonmonetary form. See United States Dept of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. 597, 607 n.11 (1986). As discussed below, federal financial assistance may include the use or rent of federal land or property at below market value, federal training, a loan of federal personnel, subsidies, and other arrangements with the intention of providing assistance. Federal financial assistance does not encompass contracts of guarantee or insurance by the federal government. It is also important to remember that not only must an entity receive federal financial assistance to be subject to Title IX, but the entity also must receive federal assistance at the time of the alleged discriminatory act(s) except for assistance provided in the form of real or personal property. In this situation, the recipient is subject to Title XI for as long as it uses the property. See Huber v. Howard County, Md., 849 F. Supp. 407, 415 (D. Md. 1994) (Motion to dismiss claim of discriminatory employment practices under ï½§ 504 denied as defendant received federal assistance during the time of probationary employment and discharge.), aff'd without opinion, 56 F.3d 61 (4th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 916 (1995); see also Delmonte v. Department of Bus. Profl Regulation, Div. Of Alcohol, Beverages and Tobacco of Fla., 877 F. Supp. 1563 (S.D. Fla. 1995).12
(2) A grant of Federal real or personal property or any interest therein, including surplus property, and the proceeds of the sale or transfer of such property, if the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not, upon such sale or transfer, properly accounted for to the Federal Government.
(4) Sale or lease of Federal property or any interest therein at nominal consideration, or at consideration reduced for the purpose of assisting the recipient or in recognition of public interest to be served thereby, or permission to use Federal property or any interest therein without consideration
United States military veterans are enrolled at Holy University, a private, religious university. The veterans receive payments from the federal government for educational pursuits and such monies are used by the veterans to pay a portion of their respective tuition payments at Holy University. Although federal payments are direct to the veterans and indirect to Holy University, the university is receiving federal financial assistance.
As set forth in the Title IX common rule, federal financial assistance may be in the form of a grant of land or use (rental) of federal property for the recipient at no or reduced cost. Since the recipient pays nothing or a lower amount for ownership of land or rental of property, the recipient is being assisted financially by the federal agency. Typically, assurances state that this type of assistance is considered to be ongoing for as long as the land or property is being used for the original or a similar purpose for which such assistance was intended. E.g., 65 Fed. Reg. 52867 at ï½§__.115. Moreover, regulations also generally bind the successors and transferees of this property, as long as the original purpose, or a similar objective, is pursued. 65 Fed. Reg. 52867 at ï½§ .115. Thus, if the recipient uses the land or rents property for the same purpose at the time of the alleged discriminatory act, the recipient is receiving federal financial assistance, irrespective of when the land was granted or donated.
Sixteen years ago, the Department of Defense (DOD) donated land from a closed military base to a State social services agency as the location for a training facility for caseworkers. The training facility has been built and is in use by the State. Students at the training facility allege sexual harassment against certain training facilitators. Because the State still uses the land donated to it by the DOD for its original (or similar purpose), the State is still receiving federal financial assistance from DOD and DOD has jurisdiction to investigate the complaint under Title IX. See 32 C.F.R. ï½§ 195.6.
A police department has a training facility located in a housing project built, subsidized, and operated with Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds. The police department is not charged rent. Thus, the police department is receiving federal financial assistance and is subject to Title IX.
Under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, federal agencies may allow a temporary assignment of personnel to State, local, and Indian tribal governments, institutions of higher education, federally funded research and development centers, and certain other organizations for work of mutual concern and benefit. See 5 U.S.C. ï½§ 3372. This detail of federal personnel to a State or other entity is considered federal financial assistance, even if the entity reimburses the federal agency for some of the detailed employee's federal salary. See Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 612 n.14. However, if the State or other entity fully reimburses the federal agency for the employee's salary, it is unlikely that the entity receives federal financial assistance. For example:
Two research scientists from the National Institute of Health (NIH) are detailed to a university research organization for two years to help research treatments for cancer. NIH pays for three-fourths of the salary of the two detailed employees, while the organization pays the remaining portion. The research organization is considered to be receiving federal financial assistance since the federal government is paying a substantial portion of the salary of the detailed federal employees. The research organization is thus now subject to Title IX.
A city police department sends several police officers to training at the FBI Academy at Quantico without cost to the city. The entire police department is considered to have received federal financial assistance. See Delmonte v. Department of Bus. & Profl Regulation, Div. of Alcohol, Beverages, and Tobacco of Fla., 877 F. Supp. 1563 (S.D. Fla. 1995).
Federal financial assistance may be received directly or indirectly.14 For example, colleges indirectly receive federal financial assistance when they accept students who pay, in part, with federal financial aid directly distributed to the students. Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 564 (1984)15; see also Bob Jones Univ. v. Johnson, 396 F. Supp. 597, 603 (D. S.C. 1974), aff'd, 529 F.2d 514 (4th Cir. 1975). In Bob Jones Univ., 396 F. Supp. at 603, cited with approval in Grove City, 465 U.S. at 564, the university was deemed to have received federal financial assistance for participating in a program wherein veterans received monies directly from the Veterans Administration to support approved educational pursuits, although the veterans were not required to use the specific federal monies to pay the schools for tuition and expenses. Bob Jones Univ., 396 F. Supp. at 602-03 & n.22. Even if the financial aid to the veterans did not reach the university, the court considered this financial assistance to the school since this released the school's funds for other purposes. Id. at 602. Thus, an entity may be deemed to have "received Federal financial assistance" even if the entity did not show a "financial gain, in the sense of a net increment in its assets." Id. at 602-03. Aid such as this, and noncapital grants, are equally federal financial assistance. Id.
To simply assert that an entity receives something of value in nonmonetary form from the federal government's presence or operations, however, does not mean that such benefit is federal financial assistance. For example, licenses impart a benefit since they entitle the licensee to engage in a particular activity, and they can be quite valuable. Licenses, however, are not federal financial assistance. Community Television of S. Cal. v. Gottfried, 459 U.S. 498, 509 (1983) (The Federal Communications Commission is not a funding agency and television broadcasting licenses do not constitute federal financial assistance); California Assn of the Physically Handicapped v. FCC, 840 F.2d 88, 92-93 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (same); see Herman v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joinders, 60 F.3d 1375, 1381-82 (9th Cir. 1995) (Certification of union by the National Labor Relations Board is akin to a license, and not federal financial assistance under ï½§ 504).
Similarly, statutory programs or regulations that directly or indirectly support, or establish guidelines for, an entity's operations are not federal financial assistance. Herman, 60 F.3d at 1382 (Neither Labor regulations establishing apprenticeship programs nor Davis-Bacon Act wage protections are federal financial assistance.); Steptoe v. Savings of America, 800 F. Supp. 1542, 1548 (N.D. Ohio 1992) (Mortgage lender subject to federal banking laws does not receive federal financial assistance.); Rannels v. Hargrove, 731 F. Supp. 1214, 1222-23 (E.D. Pa. 1990) (federal bank regulations are not federal financial assistance under the Age Discrimination Act).
Furthermore, programs "owned and operated" by the federal government, such as the air traffic control system, do not constitute federal financial assistance. Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 612; Jacobson v. Delta Airlines, 742 F.2d 1202, 1213 (9th Cir. 1984) (air traffic control and national weather service programs do not constitute federal financial assistance).16110 Cong. Rec. 13380 (1964).
It also should be noted that while contracts of guaranty and insurance may constitute federal financial assistance, Title IX specifically states that it does not apply to contracts of insurance or guaranty. See 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1682; see Gallagher v. Croghan Colonial Bank, 89 F.3d 275, 277-78 (6th Cir. 1996) (Default insurance for bank's disbursement of federal student loans is a "contract of insurance," and excluded from Section 504 coverage by agency regulations). But see Moore v. Sun Bank, 923 F.2d 1423, 1427 (11th Cir. 1991) (loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration constituted federal financial assistance since Section 504 does not exclude contracts of insurance or guarantee from coverage as does Title IX).
Procurement contracts also are not considered federal financial assistance. DeVargas v. Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Co., 911 F.2d 1377 (10th Cir. 1990); Jacobson, 742 F.2d at 1209; Muller v. Hotsy Corp., 917 F. Supp. 1389, 1418 (N.D. Iowa 1996) (procurement contract by company with GSA to provide supplies is not federal financial assistance); Hamilton v. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co., 894 F. Supp. 1014, 1020 (S.D. Miss. 1995). A distinction must be made between procurement contracts at fair market value and subsidies; the former is not federal financial assistance although the latter is. Jacobson, 742 F.2d at 1209; Mass v. Martin Marietta Corp., 805 F. Supp. 1530, 1542 (D. Co. 1992) (federal payments for goods pursuant to a contract, even if greater than fair market value, do not constitute federal financial assistance). As described in Jacobson and followed in DeVargas, there need not be a detailed analysis of whether a contract is at fair market value, but instead a focus on whether the government intended to provide a subsidy to the contractor. DeVargas, 911 F.2d at 1382-83; Jacobson, 742 F.2d at 1210. In DeVargas, a Department of Energy contract, issued through a competitive bidding process after a determination that a private entity could provide the service in a less costly manner, evidenced no intention to provide a subsidy to the contractor. Id. at 1382-83. For example:
Dept. of Transportation (DOT) contracts with TechStuff, a private company that provides training on the use of computers for a subway system. Under the contract, full price is paid by DOT for the training to be provided by TechStuff. Because this is a direct procurement contract by the federal government, the funds paid to TechStuff by DOT do not subject TechStuff to Title IX.
Finally, Title IX does not apply to direct, unconditional assistance to ultimate beneficiaries, the intended class of private citizens receiving federal aid. For example, social security payments and veterans pensions are not federal financial assistance. Soberal-Perez v. Heckler, 717 F.2d 36, 40 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 929 (1984); Bob Jones Univ., 396 F. Supp. at 602 n.16.17
The term recipient means any State or political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of a State or political subdivision thereof, any public or private agency, institution, or organization, or other entity, or any person, to whom Federal financial assistance is extended directly or through another recipient and that operates an education program or activity that receives such assistance, including any subunit, successor, assignee, or transferee thereof.
Several aspects of the plain language of the regulations should be noted. First, a recipient may be a public (e.g., a State, local or municipal agency) or a private entity. Second, Title IX does not apply to the federal government. Therefore, a federal agency cannot be considered a "recipient" within the meaning of Title IX. Third, there may be more than one recipient in a program of federal financial assistance; that is, a primary recipient (e.g., State agency) that transfers or distributes assistance to a subrecipient (local entity) for distribution to an ultimate beneficiary.18 Fourth, a recipient also encompasses a successor, transferee, or assignee of the federal assistance (property or otherwise), under certain circumstances. Fifth, as discussed in detail below, there is a distinction between a recipient and a beneficiary. Finally, although not addressed in the regulations, a recipient may receive federal assistance either directly from the federal government or indirectly through a third party, who is not necessarily another recipient. For example, schools are indirect recipients when they accept payments from students who directly receive federal financial aid.
The clearest means of identifying a "recipient" of federal financial assistance covered by Title IX is to determine whether the entity has voluntarily entered into a direct relationship with the federal government and receives federal assistance under a condition or assurance of compliance with Title IX. See Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 605-606.
Id. at 606; see also Soberal-Perez, 717 F.2d at 40-41. It is important to note that, by signing an assurance, the recipient is committing itself to complying with nondiscrimination mandates.19 Even without a written assurance, courts describe obligations under nondiscrimination laws as similar to a contract, and have thus concluded that "the recipients' acceptance of the funds triggers coverage under the nondiscrimination provision." Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 605. In this scenario, the recipient has a direct relationship with the funding agency and, therefore, is subject to the requirements of Title IX. For example:
A recipient may receive funds either directly or indirectly. Grove City College, 465 U.S. at 564-65.21 For example, educational institutions receive federal financial assistance indirectly when they accept students who pay, in part, with federal loans. Although the money is paid directly to the students, the universities and other educational institutions are the indirect recipients. Id.; Bob Jones Univ., 396 F. Supp. at 602.
In Grove City College, the Supreme Court found that there was no basis to create a distinction not made by Congress regarding funding paid directly to or received indirectly by a recipient. 465 U.S. at 564-65. In reaching its conclusion, the Court considered the congressional intent and legislative history of the statute in question to identify the intended recipient. The Court found that the 1972 Education Amendments, of which Title IX is a part, are "replete with statements evincing Congress' awareness that the student assistance programs established by the Amendments would significantly aid colleges and universities. In fact, one of the stated purposes of the student aid provisions was to provid[e] assistance to institutions of higher educations. Pub. L. 92-318, ï½§ 1001(c)(1), 86 Stat. 831, 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1070(a)(5)" Grove City College, 465 U.S. at 565-66. Finally, the Court distinguished student aid programs that are "designed to assist" educational institutions and that allow such institutions the option of participation in such programs, from other general welfare programs where individuals are free to spend the payments without limitation. Id. at 565 n.13.
While Grove City stands for the proposition that Title IX coverage extends to Congress' intended recipient, whether receiving the aid directly or indirectly, it does not stand for the proposition that federal coverage follows the aid past the recipient to those who merely benefit from the aid.
Along these lines, the Supreme Court in NCAA v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999), citing both Grove City and Paralyzed Veterans, stated that while dues paid to an entity (NCAA) by colleges and universities, who were recipients of federal financial assistance, "at most ... demonstrates that it [NCAA] indirectly benefits from the federal assistance afforded its afforded members." But the Court stated, "This showing, without more, is insufficient to trigger Title IX coverage. Smith, 525 U.S. at 468.22
In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity....The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicants or recipients subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
Furthermore, Title IX regulations provide that land originally acquired through a program receiving federal financial assistance must include a covenant binding on subsequent purchasers or transferees that requires nondiscrimination for as long as the land is used for the original or a similar purpose for which the federal assistance is extended. 65 Fed. Reg. 52867 at ï½§ .115 (2000).23
Many programs have two recipients. The primary recipient directly receives the federal financial assistance. The primary recipient then distributes the federal assistance to a subrecipient to carry out a program. Both the primary recipient and subrecipient must conform their actions to Title IX (and other nondiscrimination laws). For example:
A State agency, such as the Department of Children and Family Services, receives a substantial portion of its funding from the federal government. The State agency, as the primary recipient or conduit, in turn, funds local social service organizations, in part, with its federal funds. The local agencies receive federal financial assistance, and thus are subject to Section 504 (and other nondiscrimination laws). See Graves v. Methodist Youth Servs., Inc., 624 F. Supp. 429 (N.D. Ill. 1985).24 Education programs conducted by the State Department of Children and Family Services and by the local social service organizations are all covered by Title IX.
Under the Older Americans Act, funds are given by the Department of Health and Human Services to State agencies which, in turn, distribute funds according to funding formulas to local agencies operating programs for elderly Americans. Title VI applies to the programs and activities of the State agencies because of each agencys status as a direct conduit recipient passing federal funds on to subrecipients. Title VI also applies to the local agencies as subrecipients of federal financial assistance. See Chicago v. Lindley, 66 F.3d 819 (7th Cir. 1995). Title IX would similarly apply to any education programs conducted by the State or local entities.
A recipient may not absolve itself of its Title IX and other nondiscrimination obligations by hiring a contractor or agent to perform or deliver assistance to beneficiaries. Agency regulations consistently state that prohibitions against discriminatory conduct, whether intentional or through sex neutral means with an unjustified disparate impact, apply to a recipient, whether committed "directly or through contractual or other arrangements." E.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ï½§ 42.104(b)(1), (2) (emphasis added). For example:
A recipient department of corrections contracts with a tutoring company to provide vocational training to inmates. Employees of the contractor refuse to admit female prisoners to a welding training class the contractor is conducting. The recipient is liable under Title IX for the contractor's actions as the contractor is performing a program function of the recipient.
Finally, in analyzing whether an entity is a recipient, it is necessary to distinguish a recipient from a beneficiary. According to the Supreme Court, the Title IX regulations issued by the Department of Education "make[s] clear that Title IX coverage is not triggered when an entity merely benefits from federal funding." NCAA v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 468 (1999), citing 34 C.F.R. ï½§ 106.2(h). In NCAA v. Smith, a student athlete sued the NCAA, claiming that the NCAAs refusal to grant a waiver of its bylaw prohibiting a student from participating in athletics programs in other than the students undergraduate institution violated Title IX. Smith claimed that the NCAAs receipt of dues from its member schools, which received federal financial assistance, subjected the NCAA to Title IX coverage.
The Court, however, rejected this claim and held that "[a]t most, the [NCAAs] receipt of dues demonstrates that it indirectly benefits from the federal financial assistance afforded its members. This showing without more is insufficient to trigger Title IX coverage." Id. at 468. The Court noted that the definition of a recipient under Title IX regulations follows the "teaching of Grove City and Paralyzed Veterans: Entities that receive federal assistance, whether directly or through an intermediary, are recipients within the meaning of Title IX; entities that only benefit economically from federal assistance are not." NCAA v. Smith, 525 U.S. at 468.
An assistance program may have many beneficiaries, that is, individuals and/or entities that directly or indirectly receive an advantage through the operation of a federal program. Beneficiaries, however, do not enter into any formal contract or agreement or sign an assurance with the federal government where compliance with Title VI (or Title IX) is a condition of receiving the assistance. Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 606-607.
In almost any major federal program, Congress may intend to benefit a large class of persons, yet it may do so by funding - that is, extending federal financial assistance to - a limited class of recipients. Section 504, like Title IX in Grove City, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), draws the line of federal regulatory coverage between the recipient and the beneficiary.
Id. at 609-10. Title IX was meant to cover only those situations where federal funding is given to a non-federal entity which, in turn, provides financial assistance to the ultimate beneficiary, or disburses federal assistance to another recipient for ultimate distribution to a beneficiary.25 It is important to note that the Supreme Court has firmly established that the receipt of student loans or grants by an entity renders the entity a recipient of federal financial assistance. See Grove City 465 U.S. at 569.
In Paralyzed Veterans, a Section 504 case decided under Department of Transportation regulations, the Court held that commercial airlines that used airports and gained an advantage from the capital improvements and construction at airports were beneficiaries, and not recipients, under the airport improvement program. The airport operators, in contrast, directly receive the federal financial assistance for the airport construction. The Court examined the program statutes and concluded:
Congress recognized a need to improve airports in order to benefit a wide variety of persons and entities, all of them classified together as beneficiaries. [note omitted]. Congress did not set up a system where passengers were the primary or direct beneficiaries, and all others benefitted by the Acts are indirect recipients of the financial assistance to airports....The statute covers only those who receive the aid, but does not extend as far as those who benefit from it....Congress tied the regulatory authority to those programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance.
Title IX prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of sex in education programs or activities. In the context of traditional educational institutions,26 it is well established that the covered education program or activity encompasses all of the educational institutions operations including, but not limited to, "traditional educational operations, faculty and student housing, campus shuttle bus service, campus restaurants, the bookstore, and other commercial activities." S. Rep. No. 64 at 17, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 19. As noted in the Introduction, however, the primary focus of this Title IX Manual is on education programs or activities conducted outside traditional educational institutions. This section, therefore, discusses the scope of Title IXs ban on sex discrimination in this context, i.e., what constitutes a covered "education program or activity" for recipients of federal financial assistance other than traditional educational institutions, such as hospitals or prisons.27
In analyzing the scope of coverage under Title IX, it is critical to understand the role of the CRRA. As discussed in Chapter I, the CRRA amended Title IX, Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act by adding an explicit and expansive definition of "program or activity" that encompasses "all of the operations of" a covered entity, any part of which receives federal financial assistance, in order to establish the principle of institution-wide coverage. However, Title IX, unlike the other statutes amended by the CRRA, prohibits discrimination only in "education" programs or activities. Thus, it is necessary to reconcile the institution-wide coverage mandated by the CRRA with the fact that Title IXs ban on sex discrimination is limited to education programs or activities.
As explained below, outside the context of traditional educational institutions, a fact-specific inquiry is required to determine which portions of a covered program or activity are educational, and thus covered by Title IX. In light of the broad sweep envisioned for Title IX, and the expansive notion of institution-wide coverage mandated by the CRRA, such inquiries must be made as broadly as possible.
Congress intent in passing the CRRA was clear: to establish the principle of broad, institution-wide coverage under the four major civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination in federally assisted programs. S. Rep. No. 64 at 2, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4-5. The CRRA includes virtually identical amendments to Title IX, Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act, to broadly define "program" or "program or activity" as "all of the operations of":
20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1687. Since passage of the CRRA, courts have consistently held that the receipt of federal funds results in entity-wide coverage under these statutes. See, e.g., Knight v. Alabama, 787 F. Supp. 1030, 1064 (N.D. Ala. 1991), affd in part, revd in part, and vacated in part, 14 F.3d 1534 (11th Cir. 1994). See also United States Department of Justice, Title VI Legal Manual, Chapter VII (1998).
It is clear that the CRRA was designed to establish broad institution-wide coverage for Title IX, Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act. However, by defining only "program or activity," the CRRA did not directly address the question of how to interpret the modifier "education" for purposes of Title IX coverage. As a result, coverage under Title IX involves an issue of statutory interpretation that does not arise for the other three civil rights statutes, namely: to what extent does "education" provide a limitation on the concept of institution-wide coverage embodied in the CRRA?
The legislative history of the CRRA reveals that some members of Congress struggled with this very issue. Some legislators apparently believed and/or feared that enactment of the CRRA would effectively "read-out" the education limitation in Title IX by prohibiting sex discrimination in all of the operations of a recipients program or activity, provided the program or activity contained at least one educational component. Other members of Congress, however, apparently believed that the receipt of federal funds would subject a recipients entire program or activity to coverage under all four civil rights statutes, but Title IXs prohibition on sex-based discrimination would remain limited to the educational components of a recipients program, if any.
Most significantly, the 1988 Senate Report for the CRRA addresses this limitation. Although the Report contains numerous hypotheticals to explain the new definition of "program or activity" (most of which do not single out Title IX, referring collectively to the four civil rights statutes instead), one example does note that Title IXs coverage will be limited to education:
If a private hospital corporation is extended federal assistance for its emergency rooms, all the operations of the hospital, including for example, the operating rooms, the pediatrics department, admissions, discharge offices, etc., are covered by Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act. Since Title IX is limited to education programs or activities, it would apply only to the students and employees of education programs operated by the hospital, if any.
Of course, ordinary rules of statutory construction require that meaning be given to all phrases of a statute. See Connecticut Dept of Income Maintenance v. Heckler, 471 U.S. 524, 530 n.15 (1985). As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, "It is a familiar principle of statutory construction that courts should give effect, if possible, to every word that Congress has used in a statute." Id.
Thus, in determining the proper scope of coverage for Title IX, as amended by the CRRA, it is important to give meaning to both the modifier "education" and the phrase "program or activity." This requires that the fact that Title IXs ban on sex discrimination is limited to "education" be balanced against the concept of broad, institution-wide coverage contemplated by the CRRAs definition of "program or activity."
In conducting such factual inquiries, it is important to remember that determinations as to what constitutes a covered education program must be made as broadly as possible. This principle is consistent with both the broad sweep of coverage originally envisioned for Title IX as well as the expansive notion of institution-wide coverage mandated by the CRRA.
Notably, the Ninth Circuit has concluded that it is appropriate to conduct just such a fact-specific inquiry in order to determine the proper scope of coverage under Title IX. In Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220 (9th Cir. 1994), the court determined that whether various components of a correctional facility, such as the prison industries, the farm annex, or the forest work camp, constituted an "educational" program within the meaning of Title IX was a question of fact. Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1226.
As the Jeldness opinion illustrates, the question of what constitutes a covered education program for purposes of Title IX requires a factual determination as to whether the relevant portion of a recipients program is educational in nature. While Title IXs antidiscrimination protections, unlike Title VIs, are limited in coverage to "education" programs or activities, the determination as to what constitutes an "education program" must be made as broadly as possible in order to effectuate the purposes of both Title IX and the CRRA. Both of these statutes were designed to eradicate sex-based discrimination in education programs operated by recipients of federal financial assistance, and all determinations as to the scope of coverage under these statutes must be made in a manner consistent with this important congressional mandate.
Title IX was modeled after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and they both share a common purpose: to ensure that public funds derived from all the people are not utilized in ways that encourage, subsidize, permit, or result in prohibited discrimination against some of the people.29 Towards that end, both Title VI and Title IX broadly prohibit conduct by a recipient of federal financial assistance that results in a person being "excluded from participation in, . . . denied the benefits of, or . . . subjected to discrimination under" a federally-assisted program or activity.30
Disparate treatment33 refers to actions that treat similarly situated persons differently on the basis of a prohibited classification. In the case of Title IX, the prohibited classification is sex. Under the disparate treatment theory of discrimination, the core question is whether a recipient, through its officials, has treated people differently on the basis of sex. Here, the applicable legal standards under Title VI and Title IX are generally identical and investigative officials can rely on case law decided under Title VI in establishing violations under Title IX.34
To establish disparate treatment, the fundamental task is to show that similarly situated individuals were treated differently because of, or on the basis of their sex. This requires that the decision maker was aware of the complainants sex and took action at least in part based on that sex. This does not mean, however, that the evidence must show "bad faith, ill will or any evil motive on the part of the [recipient]."35 Disparate treatment prohibits unjustified sex-based distinctions regardless of the motivation behind those distinctions. For example, many statutory or administrative schemes that illegally discriminate on the basis of sex were created or were subsequently justified as efforts to address the special needs of a particular sex.36 It is not a harmful motive, but the decision to treat differently on the basis of sex, that runs afoul of Title IX.
Evidence of discriminatory intent may be direct or circumstantial and may be found from various sources, including statements by decision makers, the historical background of the events in issue, the sequence of events leading to the decision in issue, a departure from standard procedure (e.g., failure to consider factors normally considered), legislative or administrative history (e.g., minutes of meetings), a past history of discriminatory or segregated conduct, and statistical evidence.37
Direct proof of discriminatory intent is often unavailable. In the absence of such evidence, claims of intentional discrimination under Title IX may be analyzed using the Title VII burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).38
Applying the McDonnell Douglas principles to a Title IX claim, the investigating agency must first determine whether the case file raises an inference of discrimination, i.e., the investigating agency must establish a prima facie case. The elements of a prima facie case may vary depending on the facts of the complaint, but such elements often include the following:
If the case file contains sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the investigating agency must then determine whether the recipient can articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action.40 If the recipient can articulate a nondiscriminatory explanation for the alleged discriminatory action, the investigating agency must determine whether the case file contains sufficient evidence to establish that the recipients stated reason was a pretext for discrimination. In other words, the evidence must support a finding that the reason articulated by the recipient was not the true reason for the challenged action, and that the real reason was discrimination based on sex.41
Similar principles may be used to analyze claims that a recipient has engaged in a "pattern or practice" of unlawful discrimination. Such claims may be proven by a showing of "more than the mere occurrence of isolated or accidental or sporadic discriminatory acts."42 The evidence must establish that a pattern of discrimination based on sex was the recipients "standard operating procedure - the regular rather than the unusual practice."43 Once the existence of such a discriminatory pattern has been proven, it may be presumed that every disadvantaged member of the protected class was a victim of the discriminatory policy, unless the recipient can show that its action was not based on its discriminatory policy.44
It is also important to remember that some claims of intentional discrimination may involve the use of policies or practices that explicitly classify individuals on the basis of sex. Such "classifications" may constitute unlawful discrimination. For example, the Supreme Court held in a Title VII case that a policy that required female employees to make larger contributions to a pension fund than male employees created an unlawful classification based on sex.45 The investigation of such claims should focus on the recipients reasons for utilizing the challenged classification policies. Most such policies will be deemed to violate Title IX (assuming the actions occurred in an education or training program) unless the recipient can articulate a lawful justification for classifying people on the basis of sex.
In contrast to disparate treatment, which focuses on the intent to cause sex-based results, disparate impact focuses on the consequences of a facially sex-neutral policy or practice. Under this theory of discrimination, the core inquiry focuses on the results of the action taken, rather than the underlying intent.46 Because of this difference in focus, evidence of a discriminatory intent or purpose is not required. Indeed, "intent" is not an element in the disparate impact analysis.
Following the Title VI model, Congress delegated to each funding agency the authority to implement Title IXs prohibition of sex discrimination in educational programs or activities of recipients of federal financial assistance by issuing regulations, and those regulations have the force and effect of law.47 In furtherance of this broad delegation of authority, federal agencies have uniformly implemented Title IX in a manner that incorporates and applies the disparate impact theory of discrimination.
The courts have sustained the use of disparate impact theory as lawful and proper exercises of agencies delegated authority, even where the challenged actions or practices do not constitute intentional discrimination and thus are not prohibited directly by the explicit language of either Title VI or Title IX.48
Under the disparate impact theory, a recipient violates agency regulations by using a neutral procedure or practice that has a disparate impact on protected individuals, and such practice lacks a substantial legitimate justification. As in Title VI disparate impact cases, the elements of a Title IX disparate impact claim derive from the analysis of cases decided under Title VII disparate impact law. 49
In a disparate impact case, the focus of the investigation concerns the consequences of the recipient's practices, rather than the recipient's intent.50 To establish discrimination under a disparate impact scheme, the investigating agency must first ascertain whether the recipient utilized a facially neutral practice that had a disproportionate impact on the basis of sex.51 In doing so, the investigating agency must do more than demonstrate that the practice or policy in question is a "bad idea."52 The agency must show a causal connection between the facially neutral policy and the disproportionate and adverse impact on a protected group.53
If the evidence establishes a prima facie case, the investigating agency must then determine whether the recipient can articulate a "substantial legitimate justification" for the challenged practice.54 "Substantial legitimate justification" is similar to the Title VII concept of "business necessity," which involves showing that the policy or practice in question is related to performance on the job.55
To prove a "substantial legitimate justification," the recipient must show that the challenged policy was "necessary to meeting a goal that was legitimate, important, and integral to the [recipients] institutional mission."56 The justification must bear a "manifest demonstrable relationship" to the challenged policy.57 In an education context, the practice must be demonstrably necessary to meeting an important educational goal, i.e. there must be an "educational necessity" for the practice.
Courts have often found Title VI disparate impact violations in cases where recipients utilize policies or practices that result in the provision of fewer services or benefits, or inferior services or benefits, to members of a protected group. A similar outcome should result under Title IX where sex is the basis for the differences in impact. For example, in Sharif v. New York State Educ. Dept, 709 F. Supp. 345 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), the District Court applied a discriminatory effects test to analyze the Title IX claims of a class of female applicants for New York State Merit Scholarships who alleged that the states sole reliance on SAT scores to determine eligibility for such scholarships disproportionately discriminated against women. The District Court, in granting the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, found that the states system of awarding Merit Scholarships had a discriminatory impact on women and constituted a violation of Title IX.59 See also Larry P. v. Riles, 793 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1984), in which the Ninth Circuit applied a discriminatory effects test to analyze the Title VI claims of a class of black school children who were placed in special classes for the "educable mentally retarded" ("EMR") on the basis of non-validated IQ tests. The Ninth Circuit upheld the district courts finding that use of these IQ tests for placement in EMR classes constituted a violation of Title VI.60 Similarly, in Sandoval, the court held that discrimination on the basis of language, in the form of an English-only policy, had an unjustified disparate impact on the basis of national origin, and thus violated Title VI.61
[B]ut the district court did not consider, much less analyze, whether the defendants had shown a substantial legitimate justification for this allocation. The MTA and the State identified several factors favoring a higher subsidization of the commuter lines. By encouraging suburban residents not to drive into the City, subsidization of the commuter rails minimizes congestion and pollution levels associated with greater use of automobiles in the city; encourages business to locate in the City; and provides additional fare-paying passengers to the City subway and bus system. In these respects and in others, subsidizing the commuter rails may bring material benefits to the minority riders of the subway and bus system. The district court dismissed such factors, concluding that the MTA board did not explicitly consider them before voting on the NYCTA and commuter line fare increases. That finding is largely irrelevant to whether such considerations would justify the relative allocation of total funds to the NYCTA and the commuter lines (emphasis added).
[T]he Defendants presented evidence that Policy IDFA was adopted to address concerns that the M to M transfer program was being used to facilitate athletic recruiting in the Montgomery County school system and to help revitalize Montgomerys west side [minority] high schools. Both of these justifications are substantial and legitimate because they evince a genuine attempt by the Board of Education to improve the quality of education offered in [the] County.65
If a substantial legitimate justification is identified, the third stage of the disparate impact analysis is the challenging partys identification of a less discriminatory alternative.66 If there is an alternative policy or procedure that has less of an adverse impact but achieves the goals that were determined to be legitimate, the recipient should use that policy or procedure.
A right cannot exist in the absence of some credible and effective mechanism for its enforcement and enforcement cannot occur in the absence of a beneficiary class willing and able to assert the right. In order to ensure that beneficiaries are willing and able to participate in the enforcement of their own rights, a recipients retaliation against a person who has filed a complaint or who assists enforcement agencies in discharging their investigative duties violates Title IX.67
The Title IX regulations incorporate the requirement in the Title VI regulations, which provides that "[n]o recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by [Title VI], or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this subpart."68
Retaliation protections are designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the enforcement process itself. Because of this purpose, the merits of any underlying complaint of sex discrimination are irrelevant in assessing a retaliation complaint.69 The prohibited conduct is the act of retaliation itself.
Moreover, protected activities include more than filing complaints seeking a vindication of personal rights.70 The Department believes that a narrow reading requiring the prior exercise of personal rights is inconsistent with the broad remedial purposes behind Title IX itself.71 It is important to re-emphasize that Title VI agency anti-retaliation regulations (incorporated into Title IX regulations) provide "[n]o recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by [Title VI], . . ." Thus, anyone who asserts rights secured by Title IX is protected. Retaliation claims have their own remedial purpose in that they seek to ensure that rights created under a federal civil rights statute do not go unenforced for fear of adverse official reaction.72 This goal is undercut if recipients are allowed to retaliate against persons subject to their authority who publicly object to discrimination against others.
Once a prima facie case of retaliation is established, the investigating agency must then determine whether the recipient can articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Id. If the recipient can offer such a reason, the investigating agency must then show that the recipients proffered reason is pretextual and that the recipients actual reason was retaliation. Id. A showing of pretext may be sufficient to support an inference of retaliation if the fact finder concludes that retaliation was the real purpose of the action. Id.
Title IX and Title VI differ most in their scope of coverage. By way of summary, Title VI is broader as to the types of programs or activities covered (i.e., it covers all the operations of a recipients programs and activities) but narrow in its ability to reach employment discrimination. Specifically, Title VI prohibits employment discrimination on the part of a recipient only where a purpose of the federal financial assistance received is to provide employment. 42 U.S.C. ï½§2000d-3.74 Title IX, on the other hand, is narrower as to the types of programs or activities covered (i.e., it only covers educational components) but broader in that it reaches employment discrimination. Because Title IX does not contain limiting language as does Title VI, the courts have concluded that Title IX reaches employment discrimination in the educational programs or activities of recipients without limitation.75
Consistent with this construction, most federal agencies have joined in adopting final regulations implementing Title IX which broadly prohibit "discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education program or activity operated by a recipient that receives Federal financial assistance."76
The use of case law and policies developed under Title VII is similarly appropriate in the administrative setting. In conducting investigations alleging employment discrimination, agencies shall consider Title VII case law and EEOC Guidelines, 29 CFR parts 1604-1607, unless inapplicable, in determining whether a recipient of Federal financial assistance has engaged in an unlawful employment practice.78
While the courts, including the Supreme Court, have looked to the substantive standards and policies developed under Title VII as either controlling or helpful in evaluating claims of employment discrimination under Title IX,79 the same cannot be said of Title VIIs procedural requirements.
The Supreme Court has yet to explicitly decide whether the far more detailed and comprehensive procedural requirements of Title VII are applicable to claims of employment discrimination brought under Title IX. The lower courts that have faced this question are divided. One view treats Title IX as an independent basis for finding discrimination based on the substantive standards of Title VII, but divorced from its administrative requirements.80 Under this view, complainants filing complaints under Title IX are not subject to Title VIIs filing deadlines, exhaustion of administrative remedy requirements, and state referral requirements, but are still governed by Title VIIs substantive standards. The other view is that the more focused and detailed enforcement scheme of Title VII preempts Title IX in the area of employment discrimination.81 Under this view, employees of federally assisted education programs operated by recipients of federal financial assistance have only a Title VII remedy for sex-based employment discrimination.
The Department takes the position that Title IX and Title VII are separate enforcement mechanisms. Individuals can use both statutes to attack the same violations. This view is consistent with the Supreme Courts decisions on Title IXs coverage of employment discrimination, as well as the different constitutional bases for Title IX and Title VII. Of course, this view is important only for individuals wishing to file private rights of action in courts. Federal agencies responsible for investigating Title IX complaints alleging employment discrimination must follow the procedures discussed in Section B(5) of this chapter. This section describes a regulation jointly issued by the Department of Justice and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,82 which sets out procedures for processing employment complaints covered by both Title VII and Title IX.
As noted above, the Title IX common rule specifically incorporates the disparate impact standard as part of its prohibitions against sex-based employment discrimination.83 In addition, the Title IX common rule applies its prohibition against sex-based discrimination to the full range of activities related to the recruitment, evaluation, classification, payment, assignment, retention or treatment of employees.84 The Title IX common rule addresses various areas including the treatment of pregnancy as a temporary disability, pre-employment inquiries regarding marital or parental status, imposition of employment criteria or testing devices having a disproportionate impact, recruitment, and compensation and benefits (including equal pension contributions and benefits).
Where the Title IX common rule does not address some aspect of the employment relationship or where more detailed guidance is required beyond that provided by the Title IX common rule (and if there is no relevant guidance issued by the Department of Education interpreting its Title IX regulations), agency officials should review and apply the applicable standards and policies developed under Title VII.
Two areas raise special considerations requiring specific discussion. In some cases, recipients may attempt to modify their obligations under Title IX in an effort to comply with other legal or contractual obligations. In other cases, recipients may attempt to create sex-sensitive criteria for employment in specific types of positions.
Recipients are sometimes subject to competing and/or contradictory requirements having the potential to interfere with their ability to fully discharge their Title IX obligations. These competing obligations might result from state or local laws or find their source in third party labor or service contracts. They could include, for example, limitations or restrictions on the number of hours worked or types of jobs filled by women. Given the Supremacy and Spending Clauses, however, a recipients federal obligation to comply with Title IX to eliminate unjustified sex-based discrimination in employment is superior to its obligation to comply with local law or third party contracts. In pertinent part, the Title IX common rule provides that:
(a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with ï½§ï½§___.500 through ___.550 is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement that imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex that are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
Thus, in cases of conflict between the requirements of Title IX and obligations imposed by local law or third party contracts, Title IX controls. If an entity does not want to follow Title IX, it is free to simply decline federal financial assistance but it still may be subject to Title VII.
As noted above, Title IX generally incorporates the standards and policies developed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. Among those standards is the recognition that, in extremely limited circumstances, sex may constitute a bona fide occupational qualification ("BFOQ"). It bears emphasis that BFOQs are very narrow exceptions.85
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited . . .provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employees sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.
Complaints received by federal agencies that allege sex-based employment discrimination should be processed in conformity with the "Procedures for Complaints of Employment Discrimination Filed Against Recipients of Federal Financial Assistance."86 These Joint Complaint Procedures, promulgated jointly by the Department of Justice and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1983, are intended to "reduce duplicative efforts by different Federal agencies . . . reduce the burden on employers [and] allow . . . agencies to focus their resources on allegations of services discrimination."87 As discussed below, these procedures require referral of employment complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in some circumstances.
Under the Joint Complaint Procedures, complaints are deemed filed with the EEOC as of the date the complaint was received by the sister federal agency. Moreover, the Joint Complaint Procedures require that the recipient be advised of receipt of the employment complaint within 10 days.88 Within 30 days of receipt, the receiving agency is to determine its jurisdiction over the complaint and the procedure under which it will be handled.89
In those cases where the agency does not have jurisdiction over the employment complaint (i.e., the alleged discriminating entity does not receive federal financial assistance or it receives federal financial assistance but does not have an educational component), the agency is to transfer the complaint to the EEOC and advise both the complainant and the recipient of the specific office of the EEOC to which the complaint is being transferred.
Where the complaint alleges employment discrimination over which both the agency and EEOC have parallel authority (i.e., a "joint" complaint), the Joint Complaint Procedures direct that, absent "special circumstances,"90 individual complaints should be directed to the EEOC for processing with the referring agencys action deferred pending completion of the EEOC complaint process. In the case of a joint complaint alleging a pattern or practice of employment discrimination, however, the Joint Complaint Procedures reverse the referral presumption. In these cases, the Procedures contemplate that the agency will retain investigative and enforcement authority over the complaint absent "special circumstances" warranting a referral to the EEOC. Finally, where the complaint alleges discrimination in both the provision of educational services and employment, the Joint Complaint Procedures again direct that, absent special circumstances, the agency should retain its authority over the complaint rather than refer the matter to the EEOC.
The rationale behind the referral rules set out in the Joint Complaint Procedures is not difficult to discern. Given Title VIIs specific focus on employment discrimination and EEOCs nationwide system of complaint adjudication offices, it is logical to refer all individual complainants to the expert federal agency. However, complaints alleging a pattern or practice of employment discrimination or discrimination in the provision of educational services, implicate the core integrity of the educational program or activity of the recipient of federal financial assistance. In these cases, logic and the greater expertise of the funding agency regarding the core purposes of the federal financial assistance argue in favor of its retaining jurisdiction over these broader complaints.
Under the Title IX common rule, a recipient may not apply different rules or regulations, impose different fees or requirements, or offer different services or benefits related to housing. However, a recipient may provide separate housing on the basis of sex if such housing is both proportionate in quantity to the number of students of each sex applying for the housing and comparable in quality and cost to the student. A recipient which assists an agency, organization, or person in making housing available to any of its students  such as through solicitation, listing, approval, or otherwise  must take reasonable steps to assure itself that such housing, as a whole, also meets these requirements. However, a recipient may render such assistance to an agency, organization, or person that provides all or part of such housing to students of only one sex. 65 Fed. Reg. at 52871.
Under the Title IX common rule, recipients of federal financial assistance must not discriminate in providing facilities on the basis of sex. A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex. However, such facilities provided to one sex must be comparable to the facilities provided to the other sex. 65 Fed. Reg. at 52871.
A recipient generally may not provide an education program or activity separately on the basis of sex or require or refuse participation by an individual of a certain sex in courses such as health, physical education, industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses on the basis of sex.91 65 Fed. Reg. 52871. However, in a prison setting, penal necessities may require educational programs and activities to be offered separately on the basis of sex. While separate courses may be offered in a prison setting, penal necessity is not a defense for failing to provide equality of access to comparable educational programs to male and female inmates.
Under the Title IX common rule, a recipient may not discriminate against any person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or applicants for admission. Specifically, in appraising or counseling students, a recipient must not use different testing or other materials on the basis of sex or use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on the basis of sex. Such different materials may be used, however, where they cover the same occupational interest areas and their use is shown to be essential to eliminate sex bias. Finally, where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient must take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors. 65 Fed. Reg. at 52871.
When a recipient provides financial assistance to any student participating in an educational program or activity, the recipient must ensure that it does not provide different types or amounts of assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance, apply different criteria, or otherwise discriminate in the provision of financial assistance on the basis of sex. See 65 Fed. Reg. 52871 at ï½§ .430(a)(1). Similarly, the recipient must not assist, solicit, list, approve, provide facilities to, or assist in any other manner, a "foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person that provides such assistance to any of the recipients students" in a sexually discriminatory manner. 65 Fed. Reg. 52871 at ï½§___.430(a)(2).
Although recipients are allowed to administer or assist in administering specific sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance to students through a domestic or foreign will, trust, bequest, or similar instrument, the Title IX regulations require that the overall effect of such sex-restricted financial assistance not discriminate on the basis of sex. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§___.430(b). To ensure compliance with Title IX regulations, recipients must develop and use procedures that select students to be awarded financial assistance in a nondiscriminatory manner and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ .430(b)(2)(i). This means that a recipient cannot deny a scholarship or other financial assistance to an individual because the available monies are restricted to members of a particular sex. For example, recipients must select in a sex neutral fashion who is eligible for assistance. They are than free to allocate assistance to those selected individuals from among sex restricted scholarships. However, they cannot deny assistance to selected individuals because scholarships or other financial assistance is sex restricted.92
A recipient who assists any agency, organization, or person in making employment available to its students must ensure that the employment is not provided in a discriminatory manner on the basis of sex. If the agency, organization, or person is offering employment in a discriminatory manner, the recipient must not assist such an agency, organization, or person by providing its employment service. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ ___.435(a)(1),(2).
Under the Title IX common rule, a recipient must not discriminate on the basis of sex in providing health and insurance benefits or services. Specifically, the provision of such benefits and services to students must meet the same requirements as outlined in the employee provisions of the common rule. 65 Fed. Reg. at 52873-52874. However, these provisions do not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any recipient that provides full coverage health service must provide gynecological care. 65 Fed. Reg. at 52872.
A recipient must not apply any rule concerning a students actual or potential parental, family, or marital status that treats students differently on the basis of sex. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ __.445(a). A students pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from such termination of pregnancy must be subjected to the same policies that a recipient applies to any other temporary disability in terms of medical or hospital benefits, service, plan, or policy available all students in a recipients education program or activity. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ __.445(b)(4). Where a recipient does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or where a student does not otherwise qualify for leave under a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the students physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ __.445(b)(5).
A recipient must not exclude any student from participating in its educational program or activity, including extracurricular activities, based on the students pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination or pregnancy, or recovery from such termination, unless the student voluntarily requests to be excluded from the program or activity and placed in a separate portion of the program. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ __.445(b)(1).
In the context of high schools, at least two court decisions have addressed the issue of a pregnant students participation in extracurricular activities. In Wort v. Vierling, the local chapter of the National Honor Society dismissed a high school student who became pregnant. The high school officials claimed that she was removed from the honor society because of deficiency in character by engaging in pre-marital sex, not because of her pregnancy status. Vierling, No. 82-3169, slip op. (C.D. Ill. Sept. 4, 1984), affd on other grounds, 778 F.2d 1233 (7th Cir. 1985). The district court, properly in the Department of Justices view, rejected this claim and held that the student was excluded from participating in the honor society on the basis of her sex in violation of Title IX. Id.
Several years later, a high school student in Pennsylvania was also dismissed from the National Honor Society when she told school officials of her pregnancy. Pfeiffer v. Marion Ctr. Area Sch. Dist., 917 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1990). Here the court of appeals refused to overturn the district courts ruling in favor of the school district. According to the court, there was no clear factual error in the lower courts conclusion that the school officials dismissed the student because her leadership and character in the honor society were compromised when she engaged in pre-marital sex and not because of the resulting pregnancy from such conduct. Pfeiffer, 917 F.2d at 784 (1990). The court did, however, remand the case to the lower court to reconsider proffered testimony regarding a male honor society student who engaged in premarital sex, became a father, and married the mother of his child during high school, but was allowed to retain honor society membership. Id. at 785-786.
Under the Title IX regulations, a recipient is allowed to require students who are pregnant or have a related condition to obtain certification from a physician to confirm that a student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation in a recipients program. However, the recipient may only do so if such certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions that require a physicians attention. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ __.445(b)(2). If a recipient provides a portion of its program or activity separately to a student who is pregnant or has a related condition and who voluntarily chooses such a program, the recipient must ensure that the separate portion is comparable to the program offered to students who are not pregnant. 65 Fed. Reg. 52872 at ï½§ __.445(b)(3).
No person shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide such athletics separately on such basis.
a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
The regulations go on to provide that a recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal opportunity for members of both sexes. A number of factors are set forth to determine equality of opportunity including but not limited to the provision of equipment, scheduling of games and practice time, travel and per diem allowances, assignment and compensation of coaches, provision of locker rooms, provision of medical and training facilities, provision of housing and dining facilities and publicity. See 65 Fed. Reg. 52873 - 52874 at ï½§ ___.450(c).
The regulations give a recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary school levels an adjustment period to come into compliance with these requirements. No such adjustment period is set forth for other recipients. See 65 Fed. Reg. 52873 at ï½§ ___.450(d).
For additional guidance on how the Department of Education has interpreted these provisions as they apply to traditional educational institutions see Policy Interpretation-Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics, 45 C.F.R. Part 26 (1979); OCRs Title IX Athletics Investigators Manual (1990); and Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part Test (1996); Guidance on the Awarding of Athletic Financial Assistance (OCR letter to Bowling Green, July 23, 1998).
Title IX protects students from sexual harassment in educational programs or activities operated by recipients of federal funding. The protection against sexual harassment derives from the general prohibitions against sex discrimination contained in the Title IX common rule at _.400. Those provisions state in relevant part:
(a) Remedial action. If the designated agency official finds that a recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, such recipient shall take such remedial action as the designated agency official deems necessary to overcome the effects of such discrimination.
A very comprehensive guidance document concerning sexual harassment in federally funded education programs and activities was issued by the Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights on March 13, 1997. A revised guidance document, with a request for comments, was issued on November 2, 2000. Department of Educations Proposed Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 65 Feg. Reg. 66092 (2000) (the final Sexual Harassment Guidance is anticipated for a January 2001 publication)("Sexual Harassment Guidance"). The Sexual Harassment Guidance provides educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance from the Department of Education with information regarding the legal standards that should be used in investigating and resolving allegations of sexual harassment of students by school employees, other students, and third parties. The Sexual Harassment Guidance also can provide guidance for entities other than educational institutions that administer education and training programs covered by Title IX. Although some general principles are discussed below, readers should consult the Sexual Harassment Guidance for details on investigating sexual harassment complaints. To the extent that information in this Manual is construed to conflict with the Sexual Harassment Guidance, the Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance should be followed.
As noted in the previous section on employment, courts generally apply standards established under Title VII regarding what constitutes discrimination to guide their interpretation in Title IX cases. Although, as discussed below, the Supreme Court held that the Title VII and Title IX standards for assessing a defendants liability for money damages in private litigation differ, similar standards have been applied in defining actionable misconduct. See, for example, Alexander v. Yale Univ., 459 F. Supp. 1, 4 (D. Conn. 1977), affd 631 F. 2d 178 (2d Cir. 1980)(comparing sex discrimination in educational settings with sex discrimination in employment settings and deciding that quid pro quo sex harassment provides a cause of action under Title IX as it does under Title VII). Several years after the decision in Alexander, the Supreme Court declared that courts should accord Title IX "a sweep as broad as its language" when interpreting Title IXs scope. North Haven v. Bell, 456 U.S. at 521 (quoting United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 801 (1966)(Congress use of the phrase "no person shall be subjected to discrimination" in Title IXs statutory language means that employees, as well as students, are covered by its antidiscrimination provision.) As a result, courts interpreted Title IX as prohibiting hostile environment harassment in cases involving employees of educational institutions receiving federal funds. See Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999).
As the body of Title IX sex harassment law has evolved, the definitions of what conduct constitutes sexual harassment have remained largely the same under Title IX and Title VII but the legal standards for assessing a defendants liability for damages in private litigation under the two statutes have begun to diverge. The Supreme Court has held that a school must be deliberately indifferent in the face of actual knowledge of the misconduct in order to be liable for money damages in private litigation under Title IX. Id. In contrast, under Title VII, an employer may be liable for money damages, under certain circumstances, for a supervisors harassment of a subordinate even without notice. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807 (1998). For this reason, we will specifically note in this chapter if a case is based on Title VII.
Importantly, for purposes of administrative enforcement of Title IX and as a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance - as well as in private actions for injunctive relief -- if a recipient is aware, or should be aware, of sexual harassment, it must take reasonable steps to eliminate the harassment, prevent its recurrence and, where appropriate, remedy the effects. See Department of Educations Sexual Harassment Guidance.
Title IX prohibits sexual harassment by teachers or other employees of the federally funded entity administering an education program or activity. Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998)(school liable for money damages in private litigation under Title IX for teacher/student sex harassment if school had actual knowledge of the misconduct and was deliberately indifferent); Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60 (1992)(coach/teacher sexual harassment of high school student actionable under Title IX).
Title IXs prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex can include protections against same-sex harassment. The Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex sexual harassment can constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., et al, 523 U.S. 75 (1998) (male employees sexual harassment claim against former employer and against male supervisors and co-workers may be actionable under Title VII). Similarly, lower courts have held that Title IX applies even if the participant and harasser are of the same sex. Kinman v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist., 94 F. 3d 463 (8th Cir. 1996)(female students allegation of sexual harassment by female teacher sufficient to raise claim under Title IX); Doe v. Petaluma County Sch. Dist., 949 F. Supp. 1415 (N.D. Cal. 1996)(female junior high school students allegation of sexual harassment by other students, including both boys and girls, sufficient to raise a claim under Title IX).
While it is clear that discrimination in violation of Title IX must be "on the basis of sex," courts have held that subjecting an individual to sex stereotyping may constitute sex discrimination in appropriate circumstances. In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989), a Title VII case, the plaintiff was denied partnership in an accounting firm, due, in part, to the attitudes of the senior partners who described her as "macho" and advised her to wear makeup and jewelry and to dress in more feminine clothing. Id. at 235. The Supreme Court explained:
In the specific context of sex stereotyping, an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender... As for the legal relevance of sex stereotyping, we are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they match the stereotype associated with their group, for in forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women result from sex stereotypes.
Several circuit courts have also addressed gender-based harassment on the basis of stereotyping. Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F. 3d 252 (1st Cir. 1999)(Title VII); Galdieri-Ambrosini v. National Realty & Dev. Corp., 136 F. 3d 276, 289 (2nd Cir. 1998)(Title VII)("Evidence of sexual stereotyping may provide proof that an employment decision or an abusive environment was based on gender.")(citing Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 250-51 (Title VII); Lindahl v. Air France, 930 F. 2d 1434, 1439 (Title VII)(9th Cir. 1991); Sheehan v. Purolator, Inc., 839 F. 2d 99, 106-77 (Title VII)(2nd Cir.)(Kearse, J., dissenting, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 891, 109 S.Ct. 226 (1988)). Since Title VII legal theories are often used by courts to evaluate Title IX claims, sex stereotyping may violate the Title IX prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex. The fact that the harassment was based on the perception that the individual was not properly "manly" or "feminine" may, in appropriate circumstances, be the basis for a sex stereotyping claim filed under Title IX.
Sexual harassment may be prohibited even when it does not occur on the program providers premises, as long as the off-premises activity during which the sexual harassment takes place relates to the covered educational program. Crandell, D.O. v. New York College of Osteopathic Med., 87 F. Supp. 2d 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)(off-campus misconduct actionable under Title IX where harassment occurred in clinic during the students paid internship). Thus, harassment that occurred off the premises of an education program operated by a recipient of federal assistance would be covered. For example, if a federally assisted museum conducted a lecture series which included field trips away from the museum, harassment that occurred on the field trips would be covered.
Although courts have not yet ruled on what measures are appropriate for a recipient to take to remedy sex harassment in a context not involving an educational institution, the Department of Educations Sexual Harassment Guidance provides a starting point for analysis. If an educational provider determines that sexual harassment has occurred, it should take reasonable, timely, appropriate corrective action, including steps tailored to the specific situation. Sexual Harassment Guidance at 66104 - 66106. For example, the provider may need to counsel, warn, or take more serious disciplinary action against the harasser, based on the severity of the harassment or any record of prior incidents. Sexual Harassment Guidance at 66104. In some instances, it may be appropriate to further separate the harassed participant and the harasser, or direct the harasser to have no further contact with the participant. These corrective measures should be designed to minimize, as much as possible, the burden on the participant who was harassed. Id.
In some situations, a provider may be required to provide other services to the participant who was harassed, if necessary to address the effects of the harassment. For instance, if an instructor gave a low grade to a participant because the participant failed to respond to the teachers advances, the provider may be required to make arrangements for an independent assessment of the participants work and, if necessary, change the grade accordingly, make arrangements for the student to take the course again with a different instructor, provide tutoring and/or counseling, or take other measures that are appropriate under the circumstances. Id. In addition, the provider will also need to take steps to prevent the recurrence of harassment such as requiring the harasser to attend counseling, or even training the entire staff to ensure that they understand what types of conduct can cause sexual harassment and that they know how to respond. Id. at 66105. Under appropriate circumstances, the provider may find it necessary to terminate the harassers employment.
Furthermore, a policy specifically prohibiting sexual harassment and separate grievance procedures for violations of that policy can help ensure that all participants, instructors, employees, third parties, etc. understand the nature of sexual harassment and that the education program provider will not tolerate such conduct. Id.
The procedures outlined in this chapter are based on those provided in the Title IX common rule 65 F.R. 52867 (ï½§ï½§ __.110 - __.140). The procedural requirements discussed in this chapter are also codified in the Department of Education Title IX implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. ï½§ 106.4 - 106.9. Where the Title IX common rule differs from the Department of Education regulation, we have so noted.93
An applicant for or recipient of federal financial assistance must submit a written assurance to the funding agency that it will operate all of its education programs or activities in compliance with Title IX and the Title IX implementing regulations. The assurance must be provided either at the application stage or the award stage.94 It is important to note that by regulation this assurance must contain language that commits the applicant or recipient to undertake whatever remedial action is necessary to eliminate any existing sex discrimination or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination - whether that discrimination occurred prior to or subsequent to the submission of the assurance.
Generally, the assurance obligates the applicant or recipient to comply with Title IX for the period during which the federal funding is extended. However, with respect to real property provided to operate an education program or activity, the assurance obligates the recipient (or a subsequent transferee) for the period during which the real property is used to provide an education program or activity. Likewise, if the federal funding consists of personal property such as computers, copiers, etc., the assurance remains in effect for the entire time the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property.
The funding agency is responsible for designating the form of the assurance and the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicants or recipients subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest. However, the assurance must include language that obligates the applicant or recipient to "comply with all federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. ï½§1681-1683, 1685-1688)." The Supreme Court has upheld a funding agencys regulatory power to terminate a recipients federal financial assistance for failure to execute an assurance of compliance with Title IX. Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. at 574-575.
Under the Department of Educations Title IX regulations, educational institutions must assess their current policies and procedures to determine whether those policies and procedures comply with Title IX and its implementing regulations within one year after the Title IX regulations apply to them; this is known as "the self-evaluation requirement." Educational institutions that have already fulfilled the self-evaluation requirements under the Department of Education Title IX regulations, 34 C.F.R. ï½§106.3(c), do not have to conduct a second self-evaluation under the Title IX common rule. Thus, for example, if an educational institution receives funds from the Department of Education and has already done its self-evaluation under EDs Title IX rule, and, as a result of the Title IX common rule, is now subject to the Title IX regulations of the General Services Administration and the Department of Interior from which it also receives assistance, the institution does not have to perform another self-evaluation.
It is important to note that the self-evaluation requirement in the Title IX common rule applies only to recipients that are educational institutions (i.e., elementary and secondary schools, high schools, colleges, universities, etc.) that receive federal financial assistance. It does not apply to other educational programs and activities. For example, a prison that receives federal funds from the Department of Justice to administer a vocational training program is not subject to this regulatory requirement.
An educational institution must evaluate its current policies and procedures as they affect the admission of students, treatment of students, and employment of both academic and non-academic personnel working in connection with the providers education program or activity. To the extent these policies and procedures do not comply with the requirements of Title IX, the provider must: 1) modify the policies and procedures to bring them into compliance, and 2) take appropriate steps to remedy any discrimination that resulted from these practices. Further, an educational institution must keep records documenting the evaluation and any required modifications for at least three years and must be able to provide these documents to the funding agency upon request.
Title IX requires all recipients to regularly and consistently notify the public  i.e., participants, employees, applicants, etc. - that they do not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational programs or activities that they operate. While the funding agency can determine the specific information to be contained in the notification, at a minimum the notice must state that the protection against sex discrimination also applies to employment in and admission to the program,95 and that any questions regarding the application of Title IX can be referred to the recipients designated Title IX coordinator or to the funding agency.
The recipient must issue this notice within ninety days of the effective date of the Title IX implementing regulations or within ninety days of the date that the Title IX regulations apply to the recipient  whichever is later. The recipient must publish this notice in any recipient-operated newspapers and magazines96 or in the recipients student and alumni publications, and by letter or memorandum to participants and employees. After the initial publication, all memoranda, bulletins, catalogs, and applications must contain a similar notice. A recipient should make sure that this policy is widely distributed and easily understood.
Recipients must designate at least one employee to serve as a Title IX coordinator. This individual is responsible for coordinating the recipients efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX and its implementing regulations, including the investigation of any Title IX complaints against the recipient. The coordinators name, address, and phone number must be communicated to all applicants, participants, and employees.
One of the important aspects of Title IX and its implementing regulations is their requirement that recipients adopt and publish internal grievance procedures to promptly and equitably resolve complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of sex. The responsibility lies with the recipient to establish and maintain a mechanism whereby program participants and employees may seek to redress illegal sex discrimination and whereby the recipient may continually be apprized of and evaluate possible discriminatory policies and procedures and develop strategies to correct discrimination. Although Title IX does not specify a structure for the implementation of a grievance procedure, the U.S. Department of Education has suggested some of the basic components of an effective Title IX grievance procedure in a manual that it has issued on this topic. See Title IX Grievance Procedures: An Introductory Manual, U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (1987).
It is important to note that there is no private right of action for damages in the courts for a recipients failure to promulgate a grievance procedure under Title IX. Courts have held that failure to meet this requirement, by itself, does not amount to discrimination on the basis of sex. Gebser v. Lago Vista Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 292 (1998), Seamons v. Snow, 84 F. 3d 1226 (10th Cir. 1996).
Despite the lack of a private right of action in the courts concerning the lack of a grievance procedure, the requirement to establish a prompt and equitable grievance procedure can be enforced administratively by the funding agency. The Supreme Court has specifically affirmed the Department of Educations authority to administratively enforce this regulatory requirement. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292.
The federal agency providing the financial assistance is primarily responsible for enforcing Title IX as it applies to its recipients. Agencies have several mechanisms available to evaluate whether recipients are in compliance with Title IX, and additional means to enforce or obtain compliance should a recipient's practices be found lacking. Evaluation mechanisms, discussed below, include pre-award reviews, post-award compliance reviews, and investigations of complaints. Because Title IX was patterned after Title VI, the Title IX common rule incorporated by reference the enforcement procedures set forth in the Title VI regulations. 65 Fed. Reg. 52858, 52860 (2000). Accordingly, this section references Title VI cases as well as the Title VI Coordination Regulations and the "Guidelines for the Enforcement of Title VI, Civil Rights Act of 1964," (the "Title VI Guidelines"). See 28 C.F.R. ï½§ï½§ 42.101-42.412 and 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3. The Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in a January 28, 1999 document entitled: Policy Guidance Document: Enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Related Statutes in Block Grant-Type Programs97 relied on the Title VI Coordination Regulations for the guidance provided and specifically stated:
This document was drafted specifically with reference to enforcement of Title VI, 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d, et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in all Federal programs receiving Federal financial assistance. However, the principles set forth are equally applicable to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1681, et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs receiving Federal financial assistance; the federally assisted aspects of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. ï½§ 794, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in both federally assisted and federally conducted programs; and various fund-granting statutes that contain prohibitions against discrimination.
It is important to remember that the standard for an agency to determine whether a recipient has violated Title IX differs from the higher liability standard of proof that must be met in a court action before monetary damages are awarded. Recipients have an affirmative duty to correct Title IX violations even if no monetary damages would be awarded because of the violation. As the Supreme Court noted in Gebser, federal agencies have the power to "promulgate and enforce requirements that effectuate [Title IXs] nondiscrimination mandate," even in circumstances that would not give rise to a claim for money damages. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292. Moreover, it is the position of the Department of Justice that the standards an agency follows in finding a violation and seeking voluntary corrective action also would apply to private actions for injunctive and other equitable (as opposed to monetary) relief. See brief of the United States as Amicus Curiae in Davis v. Monroe County.
Either at the application stage or the award stage, Federal agencies must ensure that applications for Federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each education program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations.
65 Fed. Reg. 52867 ï½§__.115. Regulations requiring applicants to execute an assurance of compliance as a condition for receiving assistance are valid. Grove City College, 465 U.S. at 574-575 (Title IX assurances); Gardner v. Alabama, 385 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1046 (1968) (Title VI assurances). If an applicant refuses to sign a required assurance, the agency may deny assistance only after providing notice of the noncompliance, an opportunity for a hearing, and other statutory procedures. 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1; 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3 II.A.1. However, the agency need not prove actual discrimination at the administrative hearing, but only that the applicant refused to sign an assurance of compliance with Title IX (or similar nondiscrimination laws). Grove City College, 465 U.S. at 575. Assurances serve two important purposes: they remind prospective recipients of their nondiscrimination obligations, and they provide a basis for the federal government to sue to enforce compliance with these assurances. See United States v. Marion County Sch. Dist., 625 F.2d 607, 609, 612-13 (5th Cir.), reh'g denied, 629 F.2d 1350 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 910 (1981).98
The Title VI Guidelines specifically state that agencies may defer assistance decisions: "In some instances ... it is legally permissible temporarily to defer action on an application for assistance, pending initiation and completion of [statutory remedial] procedures - including attempts to secure voluntary compliance with title VI" (or Title IX). 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3 I.A. Thus, deferral may occur while negotiations are ongoing to special condition the award, during the pendency of a lawsuit to obtain relief, or during proceedings aimed at refusing to grant the requested assistance.99
This interpretation is a reasonable, and even necessary, application of the statutory remedial scheme. The congressional authorization to obtain relief pre-award would be sharply reduced, if not rendered a near nullity, if agencies could not postpone the assistance decision while spending the time needed to conduct a full and fair investigation and while seeking appropriate relief. Furthermore, the Attorney General's administrative interpretation is entitled to deference. See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45 (1984).100
The Title VI Guidelines recommend that agencies adopt a flexible, case-by-case approach in assessing when deferral is appropriate, and consider the nature of the potential noncompliance problem. Where an assistance application is inadequate on its face, such as when the applicant has failed to provide an assurance or other material required by the agency, "the agency head should defer action on the application pending prompt initiation and completion of [statutory remedial] procedures." 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3 II.A.1 (emphasis added). Where the application is adequate on its face but there are "reasonable grounds" for believing that the applicant is not complying with [Title IX], "the agency head may defer action on the application pending prompt initiation and completion of [statutory remedial] procedures." Id. II.A.2 (emphasis added).101
When action on an assistance application is deferred, remedial efforts "should be conducted without delay and completed as soon as possible." Id. I.A. Agencies should also be cognizant of the time involved in a deferral to ensure that a deferral does not become "tantamount to a final refusal to grant assistance." Id. II.C. The agency should not completely rule out deferrals where time is of the essence in granting the assistance, but should consider special measures that may be taken to seek expedited relief (e.g., by referring the matter to the Department of Justice to file suit for interim injunctive relief).
[T]he Federal Agency should instruct the approving agency -- typically a State agency -- to defer approval or refuse to grant funds, in individual cases in which such action would be taken by the original granting agency itself . . . . Provision should be made for appropriate notice of such action to the Federal agency which retains responsibility for compliance with [Title IX compliance] procedures.
Thus, the Title VI Guidelines support federal agencies requiring that recipients/subgrantors obtain assurances of compliance from subrecipients.102 When the recipient receives information pre-award that indicates noncompliance by an applicant for a subgrant, recipients may defer making the grant decision, may seek a voluntary resolution and, if no settlement is reached, (after complying with statutory procedural requirements), may refuse to award assistance.
Section 42.406(d) of the Title VI Coordination Regulations lists the types of data that should be submitted to and reviewed by federal agencies prior to granting funds. In addition to submitting an assurance that it will compile and maintain records as required, an applicant should provide: (1) notice of all lawsuits (and, for recipients, complaints) filed against it; (2) a description of assistance applications that it has pending in other agencies and of other federal assistance being provided; (3) a description of any civil rights compliance reviews of the applicant during the preceding two years; and (4) a statement as to whether the applicant has been found in noncompliance with any relevant civil rights requirements. Id.
The Title IX Common Rule incorporates agencies Title VI procedures, as each agency participating in the common rule has its own provision adopting the Title VI procedures.103 See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§54.605 (Department of Justice); 15 C.F.R. ï½§8a.605 (Department of Commerce); 22 C.F.R. ï½§146.605 (Department of State); 29 C.F.R. ï½§36.610 (Department of Labor); 32 C.F.R. ï½§196.605 (Department of Defense). DOJs Title VI Coordinating Regulations require that agencies "shall make [a] written determination as to whether the applicant is in compliance with Title VI." 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.407(b). Where a determination cannot be made from the submitted data, the agency shall require the submission of additional information and take other steps necessary for making a compliance determination, which could include communicating with local government officials or community organizations and/or conducting field reviews. Id.
It is recommended that agencies implement an internal screening process whereby agency officials are notified of potential assistance grants and are provided the opportunity to raise a "red flag" or concern about the potential grant recipient.104 If limited resources are a problem, agencies should develop a system to target a significant proportion of assistance applications.105
Federal agencies are required to maintain an effective program of post-award compliance reviews.107 Federal agency Title VI regulations, which are incorporated into Title IX regulations,108 reiterate this requirement.109 Compliance reviews can be large and complex, or more limited in scope.
Federal agencies have broad discretion in determining which recipients and subrecipients to target for compliance reviews. However, this discretion is not unfettered. In United States v. Harris Methodist Fort Worth, 970 F.2d 94 (5th Cir. 1992), the Fifth Circuit found that a Title VI compliance review involves an administrative search and, therefore, Fourth Amendment requirements for "reasonableness" of a search are applicable. The Court considered three factors: (1) whether the proposed search is authorized by statute; (2) whether the proposed search is properly limited in scope; and (3) how the administrative agency designated the target of the search. Id. at 101; United States v. New Orleans Pub. Serv. (NOPSI III), 723 F.2d 422 (5th Cir.) rehearing en banc denied, 734 F.2d 226 (5th Cir. 1984) (E.O. 11246 compliance review unreasonable) (citing United States v. Mississippi Power & Light Co., 638 F.2d 899 (5th Cir. 1981)); and First Alabama Bank of Montgomery, N.A., v. Donovan, 692 F.2d 714, 721 (11th Cir. 1982) (Exec. Order No. 11246 compliance review reasonable); But see Marshall v. Barlow's Inc., 436 U.S. 307 (1978).110
The Harris Court suggested that selection of a target for a compliance review will be reasonable if it is based either on (1) specific evidence of an existing violation, (2) a showing that "reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an . . . inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular [establishment]," or (3) a showing that the search is "pursuant to an administrative plan containing specific neutral criteria." Harris Methodist, 970 F.2d at 101 (internal citations omitted); NOPSI III, 723 F.2d at 425.
In Harris Methodist, the court rejected the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) attempts to gain access to records, including a vast array of records associated with confidential, physician peer review evaluations, as part of a compliance review of the hospital. The court held that signing an assurance gives consent "only to searches that comport with constitutional standards of reasonableness." 970 F.2d at 100. Where the proposed compliance review was not subjected to management review and not based upon consideration of a management plan or objective criteria, the court of appeals agreed that the HHS official acted "arbitrarily and without an administrative plan containing neutral criteria." Id. at 103.
Thus, agencies are cautioned that they should not select targets randomly for compliance reviews but, rather, they should base their decisions on neutral criteria or evidence of a violation. A credible complaint can serve as specific evidence suggesting a violation that could trigger a compliance review.
Apart from complying with the standards outlined above, it is recommended that a decision to conduct a compliance review be set forth in writing and approved by senior civil rights management. An agency may be required to show that it has selected its targets for compliance reviews in an objective, reasonable manner. A contemporaneous, written record that reflects the factors considered will aid in refuting allegations of bias or improper targeting of a recipient. See NOPSI III, 723 F.2d at 428. The written record should identify any regulations or internal guidance that set forth criteria for selection of targets for compliance reviews, and explain how such criteria are met.
Agency Title VI regulations (incorporated into Title IX regulations) are silent as to procedures for conducting compliance reviews, although, as discussed, the Title VI Coordination Regulations provide general guidance as to the types of information to solicit. Federal agencies granting federal financial assistance are required to "establish and maintain an effective program of post-approval compliance reviews" of recipients to ensure that the recipients are complying with the requirements of Title VI. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.407(a). Related to the reviews themselves, recipients should be required to submit periodic compliance reports to the agencies and, where appropriate, conduct field reviews of a representative number of major recipients. Finally, the Title VI Coordination Regulations recommend that agencies consider incorporating a Title VI component into general program reviews and audits. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.407(c)(1).112 These Title VI requirements are applicable to Title IX as well.
The Title VI Coordination Regulations require that federal agencies establish procedures for the "prompt processing and disposition" of complaints of discrimination in federally funded programs. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.408(a). Agency regulations with respect to procedures for the investigation of complaints of discriminatory practices, however, are typically brief, and lack details as to the manner or time table for such inquiry. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.107; 32 C.F.R. ï½§ 195.8. Generally, by regulation, an agency will allow complainants 180 days to file a complaint, although the agency may exercise its discretion and accept a complaint filed later in time. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.107(b). An agency is not obliged to investigate a complaint that is frivolous, has no apparent merit, or where other good cause is present, such as a pending law suit. An investigation customarily will include interviews of the complainant, the recipient's staff, and other witnesses; a review of the recipient's pertinent records, and consideration of the evidence gathered and defenses asserted. If the agency finds no violation after an investigation, it must notify, in writing, the recipient and the complainant, of this decision. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.107(d)(2). If the agency believes there is adequate evidence to support a finding of noncompliance, the first course of action for the agency is to seek voluntary compliance by the recipient. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.107(d)(1). If the agency concludes that the matter cannot be resolved through voluntary negotiations, the agency must make a formal finding of noncompliance and seek enforcement, either through judicial action or administrative fund suspension.
If an agency receives a complaint that is not within its jurisdiction, the agency should consider whether the matter may be referred to another federal agency that has or may have jurisdiction, or to a State agency to address the matter. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.408(a)-(b). If a recipient is required or permitted by a federal agency to process Title IX complaints, such as under certain block grant programs, the federal agency must ascertain whether the recipients procedures for processing complaints are adequate. In such instances, the Title VI Coordination Regulations, which agencies with Title IX responsibilities can look to for guidance, require that the federal agency obtain a written report of each complaint and investigation processed by the recipient, and retain oversight responsibility regarding the investigation and disposition of each complaint. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.408(c).
Where an agency receives a complaint about a recipient that is funded by more than one federal agency, the funding agency may avoid duplicative compliance and enforcement procedures by sharing or delegating compliance information and enforcement responsibilities. Section 1-207 of Executive Order 12250 authorizes the Attorney General to initiate cooperative programs and agreements between federal agencies to promote the effective enforcement of, inter alia, Title VI and IX. See also, 28 C.F.R. ï½§ï½§ 42.401-415.
Many agencies that fund entities that operate educational programs or activities have Title VI delegation agreements with the Department of Education (ED). However, only two of these agencies, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, have Title IX delegation agreements with ED. Delegation Agreements help to avoid duplicative enforcement efforts since they give to lead agencies responsibilities for conducting investigations when more than one agency has jurisdiction over a case. The Federal Coordination and Compliance Section of the Civil Rights Division is currently developing a comprehensive Title IX and Title VI interagency Delegation Agreement to include the remaining federal agencies that do not have Title IX delegation agreements.
Finally, the Title VI Coordination Regulations require that each federal agency, (and recipients that process Title VI complaints), maintain a log of complaints received. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.408(d). The log shall include the following: the sex of the complainant, the identity of the recipient, the nature of the complaint, the date the complaint was filed, the investigation completed, the date and nature of the disposition, and other pertinent information.
Agency staff should remember that the primary means of enforcing compliance with Title IX is through voluntary agreements with the recipients, and that fund suspension or termination is a means of last resort.113 This approach is set forth in the statute, is a reflection of congressional intent, and is recognized by the courts. See 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1; Board of Pub. Instruction of Taylor County, Fla. v. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068, 1075 n.11 (5th Cir. 1969) (citing 110 Cong. Rec. 7062 (1964) (Statement of Sen. Pastore)). Accordingly, if an agency believes an applicant is violating Title IX, the agency has three potential remedies:
(3) where voluntary compliance efforts are unsuccessful, referral of the violation to the Department of Justice for judicial action. 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1. In addition, agencies may defer the decision whether to grant the assistance pending completion of a Title IX investigation, negotiations, or other action to obtain remedial relief.114
Compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient . . . or (2) by any other means authorized by law: Provided, however, that no such action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned . . . has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.
42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1 (emphasis in original); see Alabama NAACP State Conference of Branches v. Wallace, 269 F. Supp. 346, 351 (M.D. Ala. 1967) (voluntary compliance is to be effectuated if possible). Both the Title VI Coordination Regulations and the Title VI Guidelines urge agencies to seek voluntary compliance before, and throughout, the administrative or judicial process.115 See 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.411(a) ("Effective enforcement of Title VI requires that agencies take prompt action to achieve voluntary compliance in all instances in which noncompliance is found."); 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3 I.C.
Title VI requires that a concerted effort be made to persuade any noncomplying applicant or recipient voluntarily to comply with Title VI. Efforts to secure voluntary compliance should be undertaken at the outset in every noncompliance situation and should be pursued through each stage of enforcement action. Similarly, when an applicant fails to file an adequate assurance or apparently breaches its terms, notice should be promptly given of the nature of the noncompliance problem and of the possible consequences thereof, and an immediate effort made to secure voluntary compliance. Id.
An agency is not required to make formal findings of noncompliance with Title IX before undertaking negotiations or reaching a voluntary agreement to end alleged discriminatory practices. However, there must be a basis for an agency and recipient to enter into such a voluntary agreement (e.g., identification of alleged discriminatory practices, even if the parties do not agree as to the extent of such practices).116 In addition, throughout the negotiation process, agencies should be prepared with sufficient evidence to support administrative or judicial enforcement should voluntary negotiations fail.
An agency must balance its duty to permit informal resolution of findings of noncompliance against its duty to effectuate, without undue delay, the national policy prohibiting continued assistance to programs or activities which discriminate. Efforts to obtain voluntary compliance should continue throughout the process, but should not be allowed to become a device to avoid compliance.117 Once an area of noncompliance is identified, an agency is required to enforce Title IX.
As is done post-award, agencies may obtain compliance "by voluntary means" in the pre-award context by entering into an agreement with the applicant that enjoins the applicant from taking specified actions, requires that specified remedial actions be taken, and/or provides for other appropriate relief. The terms of the agreement become effective once the assistance is granted, and typically are attached as a special condition to the assistance agreement. Three issues arise by exercise of the voluntary compliance authority at the pre-award stage: what is the appropriate scope of special remedial conditions; what is the remedy if an applicant refuses to agree to a special condition proposed by an agency; and what is the remedy if, post-award, the recipient fails to comply with a special remedial condition of the assistance agreement.
When voluntary compliance is sought at the pre-award stage, agencies may exercise heightened flexibility in designing appropriate remedial conditions, for two reasons. First, if the pre-award remedy does not fully resolve the discrimination concern, agencies may have the opportunity to rectify this matter during the life of the assistance grant. Second, since a pre-award investigation and remedial efforts likely would require a deferral of the assistance award, it may be in the interest of the applicant (as well as potentially the agency) that interim measures be agreed to that allow the award to go forward while also addressing the discrimination concern. Thus, a pre-award special condition may grant provisional relief, require that certain aspects of the recipient's program be monitored, and/or require that the recipient provide additional information relating to the discrimination allegations. Of course, the mere fact that relief may be sought post-award does not necessarily mean that full relief, using voluntary means or otherwise, should not be sought pre-award.
Agency authority to attach special conditions to assistance agreements extends no further than the agencys authority to seek voluntary compliance. Thus, if an applicant refuses to agree to a proposed special remedial condition, the agency either would have to negotiate a different condition, award the assistance without the condition, seek to obtain compliance "by any other means authorized by law," or initiate administrative procedures to refuse to grant assistance. However, an agency may not refuse to grant assistance based solely on an applicants refusal to accept a special condition unless the agency is prepared to make a finding of noncompliance and proceed to an administrative hearing. This is because the applicant has a right to challenge, through an administrative hearing, a refusal to grant assistance. See 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1.
Whether an agency may immediately suspend payment based on noncompliance with a previously imposed special remedial condition depends on the terms of the condition. As a general matter, if a recipient violates the terms of a special remedial condition, the noncompliance must be remedied in the same manner that any other post-award noncompliance is addressed -- through voluntary efforts, by the government filing suit, or by the agency suspending or terminating the assistance pursuant to the statutory procedure. If, however, as part of the remedial condition the applicant agrees that the agency immediately may suspend payment if noncompliance occurs, then that contractual provision would likely supersede the statutory protection against instant fund suspension that the recipient otherwise enjoys.
If an agency has evidence at the time of the award which does not rise to the level of an actual violation by an applicant, and thus does not warrant refusal of a grant award, the agency may consider notifying the recipient in the grant award letter that the agency has a civil rights concern. The statement could acknowledge, where appropriate, the applicant's cooperation with an ongoing civil rights investigation or its attempts to resolve the concern.118 By including this language, the applicant is on notice that there may be a potential problem and that the funding arm is aware of what the civil rights arm is doing. It also warns that a failure to cooperate could lead to a denial of funds. The language also may encourage the applicant to enter into voluntary compliance negotiations and engage in alternative dispute resolution, in appropriate cases, to resolve the alleged discrimination at issue without a formal finding or the completion of an investigation. A major advantage of this approach is that it avoids the due process concerns raised when deferral or special conditioning is utilized because, in this case, the funds are being awarded, i.e., there is no "refusal to grant," which would trigger the right to an administrative hearing.
(1) consulting with or seeking assistance from other Federal agencies . . . having authority to enforce nondiscrimination requirements; (2) consulting with or seeking assistance from State or local agencies having such authority; (3) bypassing a recalcitrant central agency applicant in order to obtain assurances from or to grant assistance to complying local agencies; and (4) bypassing all recalcitrant non-Federal agencies and providing assistance directly to the complying ultimate beneficiaries.
The Department of Justice's statutory authority to sue in federal district court on behalf of an agency for violation of Title VI (and, likewise, Title IX) is contained in the phrase "by any other means authorized by law." See 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1; United States v. City and County of Denver, 927 F. Supp. 1396, 1400 (D. Colo. 1996); Ayers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1551 n.6 (N.D. Miss. 1987); Marion County, 625 F.2d at 612-13 & n.14. In addition, the Department of Justice may pursue judicial enforcement through specific enforcement of assurances, certifications of compliance, covenants attached to property, desegregation or other plans submitted to the agency as conditions of assistance, or violations of other provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, other statutes, or the Constitution. See Marion County, 625 F.2d at 612; 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3 I.B.
Agency regulations interpreting this phrase provide for several options including: 1) referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings, 2) referrals to State agencies, and 3) referrals to local agencies. E.g., 29 C.F.R. ï½§ 31.8(a) (Labor); 34 C.F.R. ï½§ 100.8 (Education); and 45 C.F.R. ï½§ 80.8(a) (HHS):
[C]ompliance may be effected by . . . other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or contractual undertaking and (2) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.
In order to refer a matter to the Justice Department for litigation, agency regulations require that the funding agency make a finding that a violation exists and a determination that voluntary compliance cannot be achieved. The recipient must be notified of its failure to comply and must be notified of the intended agency action to effectuate compliance.119 Some agency regulations require additional time after this notification to the recipient to continue negotiation efforts to achieve voluntary compliance.120 It should be noted that the funding agency must in fact formally initiate referral of the matter to the Justice Department, because there is no automatic referral mechanism.
In United States v. Baylor Univ. Med. Ctr., 736 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1984), the Fifth Circuit held that when a referral is made to the Department of Justice, and suit for injunctive relief is filed, a court can order termination of federal financial assistance as a remedy. However, the termination cannot become effective until 30 days have passed. The court reasoned that the congressional intent to allow a 30-day period when the administrative hearing route is followed (see 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1, which provides that the agency must file a report with Congress and 30 days must elapse before termination of the funds) evinces a congressional intent to likewise permit a 30-day grace period before a courts order to terminate funds takes effect.
4) the head of the agency must file a report with the House and Senate legislative committees having jurisdiction over the programs involved and wait 30 days before terminating funds.121 The report must provide the grounds for the decision to deny or terminate the funds to the recipient or applicant. 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1; 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1682; See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. ï½§ 80.8(c) (HHS).
As noted above, funds may not be terminated without providing the recipient an opportunity for a formal hearing. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.109(a). If the recipient waives this right, a decision will be issued by the "responsible Department official" based on the record compiled by the investigative agency. Hearings on terminations cannot be held less than 20 days after receipt of notice of the violation. See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. ï½§ 80.9(a) (HHS).
Agencies have adopted the procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act for administrative hearings. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.109(d) (Justice); 45 C.F.R. ï½§ 80.9 (HHS). Technical rules of evidence do not apply, although the hearing examiner may exclude evidence that is "irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious." See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.109(d); 45 C.F.R. ï½§ 80.9(d)(2)(HHS). The hearing examiner may issue an initial decision or a recommendation to the "responsible agency official." See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. 42.110. The recipient may file exceptions to any initial decision. In the absence of exceptions or review initiated by the "responsible department official," the hearing examiner's decision will be the final decision. A final decision that suspends or terminates funds, or imposes other sanctions, is subject to review and approval by the agency head. Upon approval, an order shall be issued that identifies the basis for noncompliance, and the action(s) that must be taken in order to come into compliance. A recipient may request restoration of funds upon a showing of compliance with the terms of the order, or if the recipient is otherwise able to show compliance with Title VI or Title IX. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.110; 45 C.F.R. ï½§ 80.10(g). The restoration of funds is subject to judicial review. 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-2; 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1682. Moreover, as noted above, no funds may be terminated until 30 days after the agency head files a written report on the matter with the House and Senate committees having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1; 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1682.
42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1; 20 U.S.C. ï½§ 1682. This is called the "pinpoint provision." As discussed below, the CRRA did not modify interpretations of this provision, but affected only the interpretation of "program or activity" for purposes of coverage of Title IX (and related statutes). See S. Rep. No. 64 at 20, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 22.
Congress' intent was to limit the adverse effects of fund termination on innocent beneficiaries and to insure against the vindictive or punitive use of the fund termination remedy. Finch, 414 F.2d at 1075.122 "The procedural limitations placed on the exercise of such power were designed to insure that termination would be 'pinpoint(ed) . . . to the situation where discriminatory practices prevail.'" Id.(quoting 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2512).
The seminal case on this issue is Finch, 414 F.2d 1068. A Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) hearing officer had found that the school district had made inadequate progress toward student and teacher desegregation and that the district had sought to perpetuate the dual school system through its construction program. Based on these findings, a final order was entered terminating "any class of Federal financial assistance" to the district "arising under any Act of Congress" administered by HEW, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of the Interior. Id. at 1071.
On appeal, the Fifth Circuit vacated the termination order, holding that it was in violation of the purpose and statutory scope of the agency's power. The "programs" in issue were three education statutes, yet the HEW officer had not made any specific findings as to whether there was discrimination in all three programs, and/or if action in one program tainted, or caused discriminatory treatment in, other programs. Id. at 1073-74, 79. The court paid considerable attention to the congressional intent of the pinpoint provision: limiting the termination power to "activities which are actually discriminatory or segregated" was designed to protect the innocent beneficiaries of untainted programs. Id. at 1077. The court further held that it was improper to construe Section 602 as placing the burden on recipients to limit the effect of termination orders by proving that certain programs are untainted by discrimination, rather than on an agency to establish the basis for findings as to the scope of discrimination. Id.
As to the meaning of the term "program" in the pinpoint proviso, the court concluded that the legislative history of Title VI evidenced a congressional intent that the term refer not to generic categories of programs by a recipient, but rather to specific programs of assistance, or specific statutes, administered by the federal government. Id. at 1077-78.123 Further, even if "program" was meant to refer to generic categories of aid, the parenthetical phrase, "or part thereof", must be given meaning. Thus, an agency's fund termination order must be based on program-specific (i.e., grant statute specific) findings of noncompliance. The Court reasoned that:
[T]he purpose of the Title VI [fund] cutoff is best effectuated by separate consideration of the use or intended use of federal funds under each grant statute. If the funds provided by the grant are administered in a discriminatory manner, or if they support a program which is infected by a discriminatory environment, then termination of such funds is proper. But there will also be cases from time to time where a particular program, within a state, within a county, within a district, even within a school (in short, within a "political entity or part thereof"), is effectively insulated from otherwise unlawful activities. Congress did not intend that such a program suffer for the sins of others. HEW was denied the right to condemn programs by association. The statute prescribes a policy of disassociation of programs in the fact finding process. Each must be considered on its own merits to determine whether or not it is in compliance with the Act. In this way the Act is shielded from a vindictive application. Schools and programs are not condemned enmasse or in gross, with the good and the bad condemned together, but the termination power reaches only those programs which would utilize federal money for unconstitutional ends.
The specificity required for fund termination was also addressed by the Seventh Circuit in Gautreaux v. Romney, 457 F.2d 124 (7th Cir. 1972). In Gautreaux, the court reversed a district court's order approving federal fund termination for a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program where there were no findings of discrimination in such program, and where such action was pursued in an effort to pressure action to remedy the defendant's discriminatory conduct in a wholly separate HUD program. Id. at 127-128. The district court had previously found that defendants had violated fair housing laws yet intended to withhold Model Cities Program funds, which primarily support education, job training, and day care programs on behalf of low and moderate income families. Although a small portion of Model Cities money also supported public housing, there was no allegation or finding that any Model Cities program was operated in a discriminatory fashion. Id. at 126-27. Accordingly, the court of appeals held that the district court violated Section 602 of Title VI and the "mandate of" Finch, and abused its discretion in withholding the Model Cities funds. Id. at 128.
It is equally critical to note that, notwithstanding the need for an independent evaluation of each program, an agency (or reviewing court) must examine not only whether the Federal funds are "administered in a discriminatory manner, . . . [but also] if they support a program which is infected by a discriminatory environment." Finch, 414 F.2d 1068, 1078-79 (emphasis added). Not all programs operate in isolation. Thus,
the administrative agency seeking to cut off federal funds must make findings of fact indicating either that a particular program is itself administered in a discriminatory manner, or is so affected by discriminatory practices elsewhere in the [overall operation, e.g., school system] that it thereby becomes discriminatory.
Id. at 1079; see North Haven, 456 U.S. at 539 (approval of HEW Title IX regulations that adopt the Finch "infection" standard.) This latter analysis is often referred to as the "infection theory." Although Finch and Gautreaux were decided prior to passage of the CRRA, it is important to recognize that while the CRRA defined the meaning of "program or activity" for purposes of prohibited conduct, it did not change the definition of such terms for purposes of fund termination for a violation of Title IX. In particular, the CRRA left intact the "pinpoint" provision that limits any fund termination to the "program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been so found." 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-1.
The Supreme Court has established that individuals have an implied private right of action under Title IX (and Title VI and Section 504). The Court has stated that it has "no doubt that Congress...understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private right of action for victims of illegal discrimination." See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979) (holding that an individual has a private right of action under Title IX). In addition, several courts of appeals have held that plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations implementing Section 602 of Title VI. See Sandoval v. Hagan, 7 F. Supp. 2d 1234, 1253 (M.D. Ala. 1998), affd, 197 F.3d 484 (11th Cir. 1999), cert. granted sub. nom. Alexander v. Sandoval, __ U.S. __, 121 S. Ct. 28, 2000 WL 718812 (U.S. Sep 26, 2000)(NO. 99-1908); Powell v. Ridge, 189 F.3d 387 (3d Cir. 1999).
In Sandoval, the court found that a reading of Lau, Guardians, and Alexander, in pari materia supported the finding of an implied private cause of action under Section 602 of Title VI. 197 F.3d 484, 507 (11th Cir. 1999). Likewise, in Powell v. Ridge, 189 F.3d 387, 397-400 (1999), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognized an implied private right of action to enforce regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 602 of Title VI. The Second Circuit, however, declined to reach the issue of whether a private right of action may be brought under regulations implementing Section 602 and let stand the lower courts ruling that a private right of action is not available to plaintiffs bringing suit pursuant to Section 602. New York City Envtl. Justice Alliance v. Giuliani, 214 F.3d 65, 72-73 (2d Cir. 2000) revd on other grounds, 50 F.Supp. 2d 250 (1999). The Supreme Court will likely definitively decide this issue when it hears Sandoval. Because Title IX was derived from Title VI, the Supreme Courts decision in this matter will impact the judicial interpretation of Title IX.
Many circuits have ruled that individuals may not bring suit against the federal government for failure to enforce Title IX (and Section 504 and Title VI). See Jersey Heights Neighborhood Assn v. Glendening et al., 174 F.3d 180 (4th Cir. 1999); Washington Legal Found. v. Alexander, 984 F.2d 483, (D.C. Cir. 1993); Womens Equity Action League v. Cavazos (WEAL II), 906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990). In Jersey Heights, plaintiffs, African-American landowners, filed suit against the U.S. Department of Transportation, among others, claiming that it abdicated its duties under section 602 of Title VI to eliminate discrimination in federally-funded programs by failing to terminate funds to recipients who failed to comply with Title VI. The Fourth Circuit found that Title VI provides two avenues of recourse to address discrimination by federal funding agencies: private right of action against recipients of federal financial assistance and petition to the federal funding agency to secure voluntary compliance by its recipients. After reviewing the legislative history of Title VI, the court concluded that Congress did not intend for aggrieved parties "to circumvent that very administrative scheme through direct litigation against federal agencies." 174 F.3d at 191.
Similarly, the court in WEAL II, ruled that, absent congressional authorization, individuals do not have a private right of action against the federal government under Title VI, Title IX, or Section 504.125 906 F.2d at 752. Citing the Supreme Courts examination of the legislative history of Title VI in Cannon, the court found that Congress did not intend for private suits to be brought against the federal funding agencies. Id. at 748. The WEAL II court further concluded that because individuals already have an adequate remedy through private rights of action against the recipients of federal financial assistance, individuals could not maintain a cause of action against the federal funding agency to compel enforcement of Title VI under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Mandamus Act, or the Constitution. Id. at 752. One possible exception to these court rulings might be a situation where the federal funding agency makes a finding that a recipient is in violation of Title VI but, nonetheless, refuses to enforce its own determination. See Washington Legal Found. v. Alexander,126 984 F.2d at 488.
The most common form of relief sought and obtained through a private right of action is an injunction ordering a recipient to do something. See Cannon, 441 U.S. 667. See also, United States v. Baylor Univ. Med. Ctr., 736 F.2d at 1050, in which the Fifth Circuit held that a court can order termination of federal financial assistance as a remedy. The Supreme Court also has held that individuals may obtain monetary damages for claims of intentional discrimination under Title IX. See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75 n.8. As discussed below, agencies are encouraged to identify and seek the full complement of relief for complainants and identified victims, where appropriate, as part of voluntary settlements, including, where appropriate, not only the obvious remedy of back pay for certain employment discrimination cases, but also compensatory damages for violations in a nonemployment context. Agencies are also asked to recommend the scope of relief to be sought in referrals of matters to the Department of Justice for judicial enforcement.
As noted above, in addition to agency enforcement mechanisms, private individuals have an implied right of action under Title IX and damages may be available in such lawsuits. In Cannon, 441 U.S. 677, a female applicant who was denied admission to two medical schools brought a private lawsuit against the schools alleging violations of Title IX. The Supreme Court in Cannon reasoned that since Title IX had been patterned after Title VI and Title VI had previously been construed to allow a private right of action, that Congress intended similar remedies to be available under Title IX. The important point is that the court determined that exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required under Title IX. The court recognized that although the available administrative remedy (termination of funds) may be appropriate to prevent the use of federal funds to support discriminatory practices, it may not be appropriate as a remedy in cases in which an individual needs reinstatement or other protection against discriminatory practices. "The award of individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted her own suit is not only sensible but is also fully consistent withand in some cases even necessary tothe orderly enforcement of the statute. Id. at 706-707. In addition, the Supreme Court has ruled that monetary damages are an available remedy in private actions brought to enforce Title IX for alleged intentional violations. See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 72-75, Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624 at 630-31 (1984).
Franklin contains a detailed discussion on the merits of allowing monetary damages for intentional violations of Title IX. Id. at 71-76. The Court placed great reliance on the "longstanding rule" that where a federal statute provides (expressly or impliedly) for a right to bring suit, federal courts "presume the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress has expressly indicated otherwise." Id. at 66.127 The Court found no congressional intent to abandon this presumption in the enforcement of Title IX.128 Accordingly, the Court concluded that private individuals may obtain damages in appropriate cases.
Throughout its opinion, the Franklin Court broadly referred to the relief being sanctioned as "monetary damages." Although the Court did not define this term, it specifically rejected limiting Title IX plaintiffs to monetary relief that is equitable in nature, such as backpay. See Id. at 75-76.
In Franklin, the Supreme Court was not called upon to rule whether monetary damages are available where other types of discrimination are proven. Nonetheless, the Court noted that unintentional discrimination may present a different legal question, and damages may not be available. Id. at 74.129 Awarding damages may be particularly problematic where the violation rests on a "disparate impact" theory of discrimination. See Guardians, 463 U.S. at 595-603 (Opinions of White, J.).
In incorporating the damages remedy into agency compliance activities, agencies will need to decide when damages should be sought as part of a voluntary compliance agreement and, if damages, are requested, the amount of emphasis to be placed on the damages request in compliance negotiations. Agencies will want to ensure that the damages remedy is implemented in a manner consistent with other enforcement goals and policies, in a manner consistent among compliance agreements, and in a manner that protects the flexibility of the voluntary compliance process. To effectuate these goals, agencies may wish to draft written guidelines, and establish special supervisory procedures and internal reporting requirements.
There are several considerations that may be relevant in deciding how to exercise administrative discretion in applying the damages remedy in particular cases. One factor may be the degree of seriousness of the violation. A second factor may be whether the injury is substantial. A third factor may be whether the injury is pecuniary in nature. Since pecuniary losses represent a concrete injury and are relatively straightforward to measure, they may represent a type of loss for which damages almost always should be sought. Injuries involving "emotional distress" also should be addressed, but may require closer analysis. A fourth factor may be whether the discrimination victim has a current, ongoing relationship with the recipient that involves regular interactions between the two. If such a relationship exists and prospective relief is obtained that benefits the victim, that may weigh against providing compensation for any nonpecuniary injury that is relatively slight.
Another issue is how agencies should respond to requests by recipients that discrimination victims sign a liability release in order to obtain a damages award through a compliance agreement. As a practical matter, agencies likely will need to be open to including such a release in any agreement that provides for damages, if requested by the recipient.
The Eleventh Amendment bars a State from being sued by a citizen of the State in federal court.130 Since 1890, the Supreme Court has consistently held that this Amendment protects a State from being sued in federal court without the States consent. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 n.7 (1996)(cases cited). However, federal courts have jurisdiction over a State if the State has either waived its immunity or Congress has abrogated unequivocally a States immunity pursuant to valid powers. See id. at 68. Congress has unequivocally done so with respect to Title IX and related statutes.
In 1986, Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7 as part of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-506, tit. X, ï½§1003, 100 State. 1845 (1986), to abrogate States immunity from suit for violations of Title IX, Section 504, Title VI, the Age Discrimination Act, and similar nondiscrimination statutes. See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 198 (1996) (court states in dicta that Congress intended to abrogate the States Eleventh Amendment immunity for purposes of Title IX). Section 2000d-7 states:
(1) A state shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.A. ï½§794, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C.A. ï½§1681 et seq.], the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 [42 U.S.C.A. ï½§6101 et seq.], title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. ï½§2000d et seq.], or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.
(2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a statute referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.
The Eleventh Amendment is no bar to actions brought by private plaintiffs under Title IX to remedy discrimination on the basis of sex. It is the position of the Department of Justice that Section 2000d-7 is an unambiguous abrogation which gives States express notice that a condition for receiving federal funds is the requirement that they consent to suit in federal court for alleged violations of Title IX and the other statutes enumerated. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7 contains an express statutory abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity for Title IX suits. This abrogation is a valid exercise of Congress power under the Spending Clause to impose unambiguous conditions on States receiving federal funds. By enacting Section 2000d-7, Congress put States on notice that accepting federal funds waived their Eleventh Amendment immunity to discrimination suits under Title IX. In addition, Section 2000d-7 is a valid exercise of Congress power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which authorizes Congress to enact "appropriate legislation" to "enforce" the Equal Protection Clause. Under either power, the abrogation for Title IX suits is constitutional.
The Department of Justice has two roles to play in Title IX enforcement: coordination of federal agency implementation and enforcement, and legal representation of the United States and the funding agency. Pursuant to Exec. Order No. 12250, the Attorney General shall "coordinate the implementation and enforcement by Executive agencies" of Title VI, Title IX, Section 504 and "any other provision of federal statutory law which provides, in whole or in part, that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, national origin, handicap, religion, or sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." Exec. Order No. 12250 ï½§1-201. Except for approval of agency regulations implementing Title IX and Title VI and the issuance of coordinating regulations, all other responsibilities have been delegated to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. While each federal agency extending federal financial assistance has primary responsibility for implementing Title IX with respect to its recipients, overall coordination in identifying legal and operational standards, and ensuring consistent application and enforcement, rests with the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. In interpreting Title IX, the Department will look closely at, and coordinate and consult with, the Department of Education, the agency with the most Title IX experience and the agency with the regulations that served as the basis for the Title IX common rule.
As part of the Department of Justices Executive Order 12250 coordinating authority, the Civil Rights Division coordinated the drafting and publication of a common rule providing for the enforcement of Title IX by several participating agencies.131 On October 29, 1999, the participating agencies published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to implement Title IX.132 After receiving and reviewing comments, the agencies published the final Title IX rule on August 30, 2000.133
The Department of Justices second role is as the federal governments litigator. As discussed in Chapter VII, the Department of Justice, on behalf of Executive agencies, may seek injunctive relief, specific performance, or other remedies when agencies have referred determinations of noncompliance by recipients to the Department for judicial enforcement. Such litigation will be assigned to the Departments Civil Rights Division. In addition, the Department is responsible for representing agency officials should they be named in private litigation involving Title IX.
1 In response to the Supreme Courts decision in Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 571-72 (1984) that Title IX and other similar nondiscrimination statutes were program-specific and only applied to the particular portion of a recipients program that actually received federal financial assistance, Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 which clarified the definition of "program or activity" to cover all the operations of an entity receiving federal financial assistance. For example, if a State prison receives federal aid, all of the operations of the state Department of Corrections would be covered by Title VI and Section 504 and all of its education and training programs and activities would be covered by Title IX. 20 U.S.C. 1687.
4 In implementing this provision, the Department of Education requires a single-sex school for both sexes once it is provided for one sex. The Department of Education is currently reviewing provisions in its current Title IX regulations regarding single-sex programs to determine whether revised standards or further guidance on this issue may be appropriate.
6 As enacted in Title IX, this provision provides: (b) Nothing contained in subsection (a) of this section shall be interpreted to require any educational institutional to grant preferential or disparate treatment to members of one sex on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of that sex participating in or receiving the benefits of any federally supported program or activity, in comparison with the total number or percentage of persons of that sex in any community, State, section, or other areas: Provided, that this subsection shall not be construed to prevent the consideration in any hearing or proceeding under this title of statistical evidence tending to show that such an imbalance exists with respect to the participation in, or receipt of the benefits of, any such program or activity by the members of one sex. 20 U.S.C. ï½§1681(b).
7 The Javitz Amendment was a compromise bill passed after congress rejected the Tower Amendment, an earlier proposal to either completely exclude intercollegiate athletics from Title IX or to exclude revenue-generating athletic programs. Pub. L. 93- 380, 88 Stat. 612 (1974). The HEW regulations are codified at 34 C.F.R. Part 106.
8 The Court in Grove City College held that federal student financial assistance provided to a college established Title IX jurisdiction only over the colleges financial aid program, not the entire college. This interpretation significantly narrowed the application of the prohibitions of Title IX and its counterparts, Title VI, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and Section 504.
10 The participating agencies include: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Small Business Administration; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Department of Commerce; Tennessee Valley Authority; Department of State; Agency for International Development; Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Justice; Department of Labor; Department of the Treasury; Department of Defense; National Archives and Records Administration; Department of Veterans Affairs; Environmental Protection Agency; General Services Administration; Department of the Interior; Federal Emergency Management Agency; National Science Foundation; Corporation for National and Community Service; and, the Department of Transportation. It should be noted that three agencies that participated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services  are promulgating separate Title IX regulations, rather than participating in the final Title IX common rule.
12 In Delmonte, the plaintiff alleged that he was demoted in 1990 on a prohibited basis in violation of Section 504. 877 F. Supp. at 1564. The court held that the defendant received federal financial assistance through its participation in at least 10 federal training programs (consisting of less than one to three-day programs) both before and after the demotion, over a course of approximately twelve years. Id. at 1565-66. The court does not clearly address whether its conclusion was based on training in the aggregate, or if a single training session (with the required contractual assurances of compliance with nondiscrimination), is sufficient. Id. at 1566.
14 It is often difficult to separate discussions of closely linked concepts, such as what is a recipient and what is federal financial assistance. Accordingly, the concept of "direct" and "indirect" are discussed both in terms of "direct/indirect recipient" and "directly receive/indirectly receive federal financial assistance."
15 "With the benefit of clear statutory language, powerful evidence of Congress' intent, and a longstanding and coherent administrative construction of the phrase 'receiving federal financial assistance,' we have little trouble concluding that Title IX coverage is not foreclosed because federal funds are granted to Grove City's students rather than directly to one of the College's educational programs." Id. at 569.
Activities wholly carried out by the United States with Federal funds, such as river and harbor improvements or other public works, defense installations, veteran's hospitals, mail service, etc. are not included in the list [of federally assisted programs]. Such activities, being wholly owned by, and operated by or for, the United States, cannot fairly be described as receiving Federal 'assistance.' While they may result in general economic benefit to neighboring communities, such benefit is not considered to be financial assistance to a program or activity within the meaning of Title VI.
17 The court in Bob Jones Univ. distinguished pensions from payments to veterans for educational purposes since the latter is a program with a requirement or condition that the individual participate in a program or activity. 396 F. Supp. at 602 n.16. For a more detailed discussion of when assistance to a beneficiary may constitute indirect assistance to a recipient, see discussion of indirect recipient in section (B)(3) of this Chapter.
20It should be noted that the remaining text of this section distinguishes various scenarios for recipients and beneficiaries. While captions are used to separate different circumstances, courts do not uniformly use the same phrase to explain the same funding pattern. Thus, a court may refer to an "indirect recipient" when the situation more closely fits the paradigm of "primary recipient/subrecipient," as described in Section E of this chapter.
23 One district court has held that because the transfer of property in issue occurred before the effective date of Section 504 HUD regulations, the purchaser of the land was not considered a transferee with obligations under Section 504 but, instead, was merely a beneficiary of federal financial assistance with no obligations to comply with Section 504. Independent Hous. Servs. of San Francisco v. Fillmore Ctr. Assocs., 840 F. Supp. 1328, 1341 (N.D. Ca. 1993). However, it should be noted that the standard Office of Management and Budget assurance form used by most federal agencies includes language that requires recipients who enter into contracts to ensure that contractors comply with various antidiscrimination statutes, including Title IX. In addition, the language binding subsequent transferees, etc. has been in most Title VI regulations for over 30 years. Thus, recipients are aware of the fact that nondiscrimination statutes such as Title VI and Title IX, which are triggered by receipt of federal financial assistance, are binding on transferees, etc. Since Title IX is based on Title VI, the Title VI provisions on coverage of transferees are applicable to Title IX. Moreover, although most agencies Title IX regulations did not become effective until August 30, 2000, Title IX itself has been in effect since 1972. Thus, it is the Department of Justices view that Title IX statutory obligations are binding on all recipients, successors, transferees, assignees, and contractors who receive federal financial assistance, both before and after the date of the Title IX regulations, despite the one district court case cited above.
24The Graves court described the local agency as an "indirect" recipient since the federal money flowed "through another recipient," and compared this situation to Grove City College's indirect receipt of BEOG funds from students. Id. at 433. Given that the funding was distributed to a State agency and a portion allocated to a local entity, the more accurate description is that of primary/subrecipient.
28It should be noted that the 1984 House Report regarding an earlier version of the CRRA, which defined "recipient" rather than "program or activity," also described coverage as limited to "education." This description is instructive since sponsors of the CRRA, as eventually enacted, later noted that, despite the new language, coverage would operate in the same manner envisioned for the prior bill. Thus, it is worth noting that the 1984 House Report described Title IXs scope of coverage as follows:
An education recipient has a different scope of coverage depending upon whether the entity receiving federal funds has education as a primary purpose. If the recipient does have education as its primary purpose, such as colleges, universities, school districts, training institutes, and academies, then the federal funds result in institution-wide coverage. If the entity receiving federal funds does not have education as a primary purpose yet engages in educational functions, then all of its education-related functions are covered. For this entity, its other functions are not necessarily covered unless there is a link between the education function and the non-education functions.

Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 170 (1st Cir. 1996), cert denied, 520 U.S. 1186 (1997); Yusuf v. Vassar College, 35 F.3d 709, 714 (2 nd Cir. 1994). Indeed, one of the earlier legislative proposals of what ultimately became Title IX sought to amend Title VI itself by adding sex as one of its prohibited bases of discrimination. See North Haven , 456 U.S. at 546 (Powell, J., dissenting).

For a discussion of the scope of Congresss independent enforcement authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see United States v. Morrison , __ U.S. at __, 120 S.Ct. 1749, 1755-59; Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 80, 120 S.Ct. 631, 644 (2000).
36 See, e.g., Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 726-730 (1982) (maintenance of single sex nursing school as compensation for assumed prior discrimination rejected as perpetuating sex stereotypes); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 534-46 (1996) (benign justification in defense of a categorical exclusion does not block inquiries into actual purposes of and factual support for the exclusion). It should be noted that both of these cases are Constitutional cases, not Title IX cases.
39 It is important to remember that the "prima facie case method established in McDonnell Douglas was never intended to be rigid, mechanized or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination." United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1982) (quoting Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978)).
For example, it should be noted that the McDonnell Douglas prima facie framework for Title VII claims does not require that the applicant selected for the position be of a different race, color, or national origin than the complainant. Under McDonnell Douglas, the complainant only needs to show that "after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainants qualifications." McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Several courts dealing with this issue in the Title VII context have noted that the fact that the applicant selected in place of the complainant is of a different race "may help to raise an inference of discrimination," but it is not necessarily dispositive on the question of discriminatory intent. Byers v. Dallas Morning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 427 (5 th Cir. 2000)(internal citations omitted); see also Pivirotto v. Innovative Systems, Inc. , 191 F.3d 344, 354 (3 rd Cir. 1999); Jackson v. Richards Med. Co., 961 F.2d 575, 587 n.12 (6 th Cir. 1992).
41 See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., __ U.S. __, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2108 (2000) (finder of fact may infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of an employers explanation); St. Marys Honor Ct. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 514 (1993) (burden on complainant to establish that challenged conduct "was the product of unlawful discrimination").
46 Disparate impact is also referred to as "disproportionate impact" or "adverse impact." Regardless of the descriptive phrase used, all refer to the process of evaluating facially neutral policies or practices that in fact result in the burdens of a policy or practice being borne more heavily by members of one sex(or race or national origin) than another.

74 This is not to say that the employment practices of a recipient of non-employment related assistance will always be beyond the reach of Title VI. Where such employment discrimination so infects the tone and tenor of a program or activity that it subjects beneficiaries to an oppressive discriminatory atmosphere, enforcement action under Title VI is authorized.

78 29 C.F.R. ï½§1691.4. This provision is part of general regulations adopted jointly by the Department of Justice and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission governing the handling of employment discrimination complaints received by federal funding agencies. Those general regulations are discussed more fully in subsection B.6 of this Chapter.
86 28 C.F.R ï½§ï½§42.601-42.613 (DOJ); 29 C.F.R. ï½§ï½§1691.1- 1691.13 (EEOC)(hereinafter cited as "Joint Complaint Procedures"). The Joint Complaint Procedures do not apply to complaints under Executive Order 11246 (which is enforced by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs), the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, as amended, or the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (which are enforced by the Departments Office of Justice Programs). Id. at ï½§42.601 and ï½§1691.1.
90 The phrase "special circumstances" is used throughout the Joint Complaint Procedures. In using this phrase, the Joint Complaint Procedures seek to recognize the need for administrative flexibility in processing complaints. For example, an agency might conclude that special circumstances argue in favor of retaining a complaint that ordinarily should be referred to the EEOC where the complaint was related to or in furtherance of a pending investigation of the same recipient.
97 This document was issued pursuant to the Assistant Attorney General authority under Executive Order 12250. This Order charges the Attorney General with with the responsibility for ensuring for the consistent and effective implementation of various laws prohibiting discriminatory practices in federal programs and programs receiving federal financial assistance, including Title IX among other statutes. The Attorney Generals authority under the Executive Order, except for the approval of regulations, was delegated to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 28 C.F.R. ï½§0.51.
99 The Title VI Guidelines distinguish between the applicability of an agency's deferral authority for initial or one-time awards versus continuing, periodic awards. The Title VI Guidelines state that agencies have deferral authority with regard to "applications for one-time or noncontinuing assistance and initial applications for new or existing programs of continuing assistance." 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 50.3 II.A. In contrast, if an application for funds has been approved and a recipient is entitled to "future, periodic payments," or if "assistance is given without formal application pursuant to statutory direction or authorization," distribution of funds may not be deferred or withheld unless all the Title VI statutory procedures for a termination of funds are followed. Id. II.B.
The Title VI Guidelines do not specify what may constitute "abnormal" or exceptional circumstances to warrant deferral of a continuing grant. In these renewal or continuation situations, the Title VI Guidelines indicate that an assurance of compliance or a nondiscrimination plan may be required prior to continuing the payout of funds.
100 Subsequent to the adoption of Title VI, Congress on at least two occasions has refused to prohibit agencies from exercising pre-award deferral authority. In 1966, in considering the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1966, the House adopted a provision that effectively would have prohibited pre-award deferrals of certain education grants by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The amendment, offered by Representative Fountain, provided that no deferral could occur unless and until there was a formal finding, after opportunity for hearing, that the applicant was violating Title VI. 112 Cong. Rec. 25,573 (1966). Representative Fountain argued that a deferral was the same as a refusal, and accordingly that deferrals should be subject to the same hearing procedure required to refuse or terminate assistance. Id. at 25,573-74. In opposition, Representative Celler argued that the amendment would preclude HEW from obtaining pre-award relief since the award procedure would be completed before the Title VI hearing could be held. Id. at 25,575. During the debate, Rep. Celler noted that HEW was acting pursuant to the directives set out in the Title VI Guidelines. Id. The Senate version did not include any limitation on deferrals. In conference, the prohibition was deleted and replaced with a durational/procedural limitation on certain HEW deferrals. Conf. Rep. No. 2309, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966), reprinted in 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3896. Codified at 42 U.S.C. ï½§ 2000d-5. Again in 1976, in adopting the Education Amendments of 1976, Congress imposed a durational/procedural limitation on HEW deferral authority, codified at 20 U.S.C. 1232i(b), but rejected a House passed amendment effectively prohibiting specified HEW deferrals. 122 Cong. Rec. 13411-13416; H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1701, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 242-43 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4943-44. This post-adoption legislative history buttresses the conclusion that deferrals are an appropriate application of the pre-award remedial authority granted agencies by Congress. See Board of Pub. Instruction of Palm Beach County, Fla. v. Cohen, 413 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir. 1969).
101 The Title VI Guidelines note that deferral may be more appropriate where it will be difficult during the life of the grant to obtain compliance, e.g., where the application is for noncontinuing assistance. On the other hand, deferral may be less appropriate where full compliance may be achieved during the life of the grant, e.g., where the application is for a program of continuing assistance. Where the grant of assistance is not deferred despite a concern about noncompliance, the Title VI Guidelines advise that
the applicant should be given prompt notice of the asserted noncompliance; funds should be paid out for short periods only, with no long-term commitment of assistance given; and the applicant advised that acceptance of the funds carries an enforceable obligation of nondiscrimination and the risk of invocation of severe sanctions, if noncompliance in fact is found. Id. II.A.2.
103 As discussed earlier, the Title IX Common Rule and this Manual do not cover the Department of Education and its recipients, which have long been subject to the Department of Educations Title IX regulations and guidance. Nor are preaward reviews and related requirements delegable to the Department of Education absent its consent.
106 Post-award reviews may be limited to a "desk audit," i.e., a review of documentation submitted by the recipient, or may involve an on-site review. In either case, an agency will demand the production of or access to records, and this discussion addresses the limits on an agency's demand for such records.
110 As mentioned above, it is assumed that the first two factors can be established. First, that the access provision is an appropriate exercise of agency authority to issue regulations consistent with the statute. Second, it is assumed that any data sought will be relevant to an evaluation of whether the recipient's employment practices or delivery of services are discriminatory.
112 "All Federal staff determinations of Title VI, (as well as Title IX) compliance shall be made by, or be subject to the review of, the agency's civil rights office." 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.407(a). Where regional or area offices of federal agencies have responsibility for approving applications or specific projects, the agency shall "include personnel having Title VI review responsibility on the staffs" of these offices. These personnel will conduct the post-approval compliance reviews. Id.
In this era of downsizing, it is understood that not all field offices will have Title IX staff. This element of review, however, should be conducted and reviewed by experienced Title IX personnel, whether as a full time or collateral duty, and whether or not as members of the office in issue.
115 Agencies are strongly encouraged to make use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), whenever appropriate. Both the President and the Attorney General have encouraged the use of alternative dispute resolution in matters that are the subject of civil litigation. See Executive Order 12988 and Attorney General Order OBD 1160.1. The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 authorizes the use of ADR to resolve administrative disputes. 5 U.S.C. ï½§ 571 et seq.). ADR can consist of anything from the use of a neutral third party or mediator to informally resolving a matter without completing a full investigation.
117 Although Title VI (and, thus, Title IX), do not provide a specific limit to the time period within which voluntary compliance may be sought, it is clear that a request for voluntary compliance, if not followed by responsive action on the part of the institution within a reasonable time, does not relieve the agency of the responsibility to enforce Title IX by one of the two alternative means contemplated by the statute. A consistent failure to do so is a dereliction of duty reviewable in the courts. 28 C.F.R. ï½§ 42.411(b).
In reviewing an application for funding, we consider whether the applicant is in compliance with federal civil rights laws. A determination of noncompliance could lead to a denial of assistance or an award conditioned on remedial action being taken. We are aware that the Department's Civil Rights Division is conducting an investigation involving possible civil rights violations. The Civil Rights Division has advised us that your agency is cooperating with its investigation, and we have taken that into account in deciding to approve your grant application.
121 The congressional intent behind the 30 day requirement was to include seemingly neutral third parties, (the relevant Congressional committees), to ensure that the decision to terminate funds was fair, reasoned, and not arbitrary. See 110 Cong. Rec. 2498 (1964) (Statement of Cong. Willis); 110 Cong. Rec. 7059 (1964) (Statement of Sen. Pastore).
122 Much of the legislative debate on Title VI centered on the potential scope of any termination of assistance due to a failure to comply with the rules effectuating Section 601. The Dirksen-Mansfield substitute bill, which was developed through informal, bipartisan conferences, sought to answer those concerns. For a listing and explanation of specific changes made by the substitute see, 110 Cong. Rec. 12817-12820 (1964) (Report of Senator Dirksen). Senator Humphrey explained the purpose behind the substitute language.
Some Senators have expressed the fear that in its original form Title VI would authorize cutting off of all federal funds going to a state for a particular program even though only part of the state were guilty of racial discrimination in that program. And some Senators have feared that the title would authorize canceling all federal assistance to a state if it were discriminating in any of the federally-assisted programs in that State.
As was explained a number of times on the floor of the Senate, these interpretations of Title VI are inaccurate. The title is designed to limit any termination of federal assistance to the particular offenders in the particular area where the unlawful discrimination occurs. Since this was our intention, we have made this specific in the provisions of Title VI by adding language to 602 to spell out these limitations more precisely. This language provides that any termination of federal assistance will be restricted to the particular political subdivision which is violating non-discriminatory regulations established under Title VI. It further provides that the termination shall affect only the particular program, or part thereof, in which such a violation is taking place.
Proponents of the bill have continually made it clear that it is the intent of Title VI not to require wholesale cutoffs of Federal [f]unds from all Federal programs in entire States, but instead to require a careful case-by-case application of the principle of nondiscrimination to those particular activities which are actually discriminatory or segregated.
128 The Court examined congressional intent expressed both prior to and after its decision in Cannon. When Title IX was enacted, Congress was silent on the subject of a private right of action, but the Court noted that Congress acted in the context of the prevailing presumption in favor of all available remedies. Id. at 72. Following Cannon, Title IX (and Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act) were amended on two occasions, and neither action evidenced congressional disagreement with this presumption. Id. at 72-73. First, Congress added 42 U.S.C. ï½§2000d-7 through the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, to abrogate the States Eleventh Amendment immunity in suits under these statutes. Second, Congress added 42 U.S.C. ï½§2000d-4a under the Civil Rights Restoration Act of to restore the broad scope of programs covered by these statutes.
129 The Court explained that the problem with "permitting monetary damages for an unintentional violation is that the receiving entity of federal funds lacks notice that it will be liable for a monetary award." Id. at 74. The notice problem is a function of the consensual nature of an entitys decision to accept federal funds and the conditions attached to their receipt. The entity weighs the benefits and burdens before accepting the funds, including the nondiscrimination obligations that attach to the funding. The concern is that where the violation is unintentional, particularly if it is a "disparate impact" violation, the recipient may not have been sufficiently aware at the time the funds were accepted that the nature and scope of the nondiscrimination obligation included a prohibition on the specific behavior subsequently found to constitute unlawful discrimination. Accordingly, responsibility for money damages may not have been foreseen. See id.; Guardians, 463 U.S. at 596-597 (White, J., joined by Rehnquist, J.); Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).
130 U.S. Const. Amend XI states: "The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or subjects of any Foreign State." See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 11 (1890).
131 The participating agencies include: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Small Business Administration; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Department of Commerce; Department of Labor; Tennessee Valley Authority; Department of State; Agency for International Development; Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Justice; Department of Labor; Department of the Treasury; Department of Defense; National Archives and Records Administration; Department of Veterans Affairs; Environmental Protection Agency; General Services Administration; Department of the Interior; Federal Emergency Management Agency; National Science Foundation; Corporation for National and Community Service; and, the Department of Transportation.
132 See 64 Fed. Reg. 58567 (1999). Three agencies that participated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services are promulgating separate Title IX regulations, rather than participate in the final Title IX common rule.
