     ยง  6441.  Affirmative consent to sexual activity. 1. Every institution  
   shall adopt the following definition of affirmative consent as  part  of  
   its  cod e  of conduct: "Affirmative consent is a knowing, voluntary, and  
   mutual decision among all participants to  engage  in  sexual  activity.  
   Consent  can  be  given  by  words or actions, as long as those words or  
   actions create clear permission rega rding willingness to engage  in  the  
   sexual  activity.  Silence or lack of resistance, in and of itself, does  
   not demonstrate consent. The definition of consent does not  vary  based  
   upon a participant's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, o r gender  
   expression."  
     2.  Each  institution's  code  of  conduct shall reflect the following  
   principles as guidance for the institution's community:  
     a. Consent to any sexual  act  or  prior  consensual  sexual  activity  
   between or with a ny party does not necessarily constitute consent to any  
   other sexual act.  
     b. Consent is required regardless of whether the person initiating the  
   act is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.  
     c. Consent may be initially given but withdrawn at any time.  
     d.  Consent  cannot  be  given  when  a person is incapacitated, which  
   occurs when an individual lacks  the  ability  to  knowingly  choose  to  
   participate in sexual activity. Incapacitation may be caused by the lack  
   of  consciousness or being asleep, being involuntarily restrained, or if  
   an individual otherwise cannot consent.   Depending  on  the  degree  of  
   intoxication,  someone  who is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or  
   other intoxicants may be incap acitated and therefore unable to consent.  
     e. Consent cannot be given when it is  the  result  of  any  coercion,  
   intimidation, force, or threat of harm.  5 
 
     f.  When consent is withdrawn or can no longer be given, sexual activ - 
   ity must stop.   
     ยง 6442. Policy for alcohol and/or drug use amnesty. 1. Every  institu - 
   tion  shall adopt and implement the following policy as part of its code  
   of conduct: "The health and safety of every student at the {Institution}  
   is of utmost importance. {Institution} recognizes that students who have  
   been drinking and/or using drugs  (whether  such  use  is  voluntary  or  
   involuntary)  at  the  time  that violence, including but not limited to  
   domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexu al  assault  occurs  
   CHAP. 76                           4  
  
   may be hesitant to report such incidents due to fear of potential conse - 
   quences   for  their  own  conduct.  {Institution}  strongly  encourages  
   students to report domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  stalking,  or  
   sexual  assault  to  institution  officials.  A bystander acting in good  
   faith or a reporting individual acting in good faith that discloses  any  
   incident  of  domestic  violence,  dating  violence, stalking, or sexual 
   assault to {Institution's} officials or  law  enforcement  will  not  be  
   subject  to  {Institution's}  code  of  conduct action for violations of  
   alcohol and/or drug use policies occurring at or near the  time  of  the  
   commission of the domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexu - 
   al assault."   
     2.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be construed to limit an insti - 
   tution's ability to provide amnesty in additional circumstances.

   implement  the  following "Students' Bill of Rights" as part of its code

   and seek a response, pursuant to section sixty -four  hundred  forty -four 
   of this article, and the options for confidential disclosure pursuant to  
   section sixty -four hundred forty -six of this article: "All students have  6 
 
   the  right  to:  1.  Make a report to local law enforcement and/or state

   reporting  domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  stalking,  or  sexual  
   assault but wishes to mainta in confidentiality or does  not  consent  to  
   the  institution's  request  to  initiate an investigation, the Title IX  
   Coordinator must weigh the request against the institution's  obligation  
   to provide a safe, non -discriminatory environment for all members of its

   portation, employment, and other reasonable and available accommodations

   awareness event such as candlelight vigils, protests,  or  other  public

   on such information. The institution may use the information provided at  
   such an event  to  inform  its  efforts  for  additional  education  and  
   prevention efforts;  
     f.  Information  about  existing  and available methods to anonymously  
   disclose including, but not limited to information on relevant confiden -

   gated to issue timely warnings of crimes enumerated  in  the  Clery  Act  
   occurring within relevant geography that represent a serious or continu - 
   ing  threat  to  students  and  employees, except in those circumstances  
   where issuing such a warning  may  compromise  current  law  enforcement  
   efforts  or  when  the  warning  itself  could  potentially identify the  
   reporting individual; that  a reporting individual shall not  be  identi - 
   fied in a timely warning; that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy  
   Act,  20  U.S.C.  1232g,  allows  institutions to share information with  
   parents when i. there is a health or safety emergency,  or ii.  when  the

   disclose or the information disclosed.  
     3. If the institution determines that an investigation is required, it  
   shall notify the reporting individuals  and  take  immediate  action  as  
   necessary to  protect and assist them.

   prior to conducting an investigation. Declining to consent to an  inves - 
   tigation  shall  be  honored  unless  the institution determines in good  
   faith that failure to investigate does not adequately mitigate a  poten - 
   tial  risk  of  harm to the reporting individual or other members of the  
   community.  Honoring such a request may limit the institution's  ability  
                                      11                           CHAP. 76

   such  as  security  footag e, and whether available information reveals a  
   pattern of perpetration at a given location or by a particular group.
