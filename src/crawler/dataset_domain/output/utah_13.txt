The Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 states: No person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits
of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance. Schools may not retaliate against any person for opposing
an unlawful educational practice or policy, or made charges, testified or participated
in any complaint action under Title IX. All districts and charter schools must have
a designated Title IX coordinator with their contact information prominently posted
in visible areas of the schools, including handbooks, and on the school's website
to ensure protections to students who are being discriminated based on their sex.
